# Other Methods

* `reset`: set all Vars to their default value for the given state (including substates).
* `get_value`: returns the value of a Var **without tracking changes to it**. This is useful
   for serialization where the tracking wrapper is considered unserializable.
* `dict`: returns all state Vars (and substates) as a dictionary. This is
  used internally when a page is first loaded and needs to be "hydrated" and
  sent to the client.

## Special Attributes

* `dirty_vars`: a set of all Var names that have been modified since the last
  time the state was sent to the client. This is used internally to determine
  which Vars need to be sent to the client after processing an event.


# Lifespan Tasks

_Added in v0.5.2_

Lifespan tasks are coroutines that run when the backend server is running. They
are useful for setting up the initial global state of the app, running periodic
tasks, and cleaning up resources when the server is shut down.

Lifespan tasks are defined as async coroutines or async contextmanagers. To avoid
blocking the event thread, never use `time.sleep` or perform non-async I/O within
a lifespan task.

In dev mode, lifespan tasks will stop and restart when a hot-reload occurs.

## Tasks

Any async coroutine can be used as a lifespan task. It will be started when the
backend comes up and will run until it returns or is cancelled due to server
shutdown. Long-running tasks should catch `asyncio.CancelledError` to perform
any necessary clean up.

```python
async def long_running_task(foo, bar):
    print(f"Starting \{foo} \{bar} task")
    some_api = SomeApi(foo)
    try:
        while True:
            updates = some_api.poll_for_updates()
            other_api.push_changes(updates, bar)
            await asyncio.sleep(5)  # add some polling delay to avoid running too often
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        some_api.close()  # clean up the API if needed
        print("Task was stopped")
```

### Register the Task

To register a lifespan task, use `app.register_lifespan_task(coro_func, **kwargs)`.
Any keyword arguments specified during registration will be passed to the task.

If the task accepts the special argument, `app`, it will be an instance of the `FastAPI` object
associated with the app.

```python
app = rx.App()
app.register_lifespan_task(long_running_task, foo=42, bar=os.environ["BAR_PARAM"])
```

## Context Managers

Lifespan tasks can also be defined as async contextmanagers. This is useful for
setting up and tearing down resources and behaves similarly to the ASGI lifespan
protocol.

Code up to the first `yield` will run when the backend comes up. As the backend
is shutting down, the code after the `yield` will run to clean up.

Here is an example borrowed from the FastAPI docs and modified to work with this
interface.

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager


def fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model(x: float):
    return x * 42


ml_models = \{}


@asynccontextmanager
async def setup_model(app: FastAPI):
    # Load the ML model
    ml_models["answer_to_everything"] = fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model
    yield
    # Clean up the ML models and release the resources
    ml_models.clear()

...

app = rx.App()
app.register_lifespan_task(setup_model)
```

# Exception handlers

_Added in v0.5.7_

Exceptions handlers are functions that can be assigned to your app to handle exceptions that occur during the application runtime.
They are useful for customizing the response when an error occurs, logging errors, and performing cleanup tasks.

## Types

Reflex support two type of exception handlers `frontend_exception_handler` and `backend_exception_handler`.

They are used to handle exceptions that occur in the `frontend` and `backend` respectively.

The `frontend` errors are coming from the JavaScript side of the application, while `backend` errors are coming from the the event handlers on the Python side.

## Register an Exception Handler

To register an exception handler, assign it to `app.frontend_exception_handler` or `app.backend_exception_handler` to assign a function that will handle the exception.

The expected signature for an error handler is `def handler(exception: Exception)`.

```md alert warning
# Only named functions are supported as exception handler.
```

## Examples

```python
import reflex as rx

def custom_frontend_handler(exception: Exception) -> None:
    # My custom logic for frontend errors
    print("Frontend Error: " + str(exception))

def custom_backend_handler(exception: Exception) -> Optional[rx.event.EventSpec]:
    # My custom logic for backend errors
    print("Backend Error: " + str(exception))

app = rx.App(
    frontend_exception_handler = custom_frontend_handler,
    backend_exception_handler = custom_backend_handler
    )
```

```python exec box
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.styles.styles import get_code_style, cell_style

class RouterState(rx.State):
    pass


router_data = [
      {"name": "rx.State.router.page.host", "value": RouterState.router.page.host},
      {"name": "rx.State.router.page.path", "value": RouterState.router.page.path},

      {"name": "rx.State.router.headers.sec_websocket_key", "value": RouterState.router.headers.sec_websocket_key},
      {"name": "rx.State.router.headers.sec_websocket_extensions", "value": RouterState.router.headers.sec_websocket_extensions},
      {"name": "rx.State.router.headers.accept_encoding", "value": RouterState.router.headers.accept_encoding},
      {"name": "rx.State.router.headers.accept_language", "value": RouterState.router.headers.accept_language},
      {"name": "rx.State.router.headers.raw_headers", "value": RouterState.router.headers.raw_headers.to_string()},
  ]

```

# State Utility Methods

The state object has several methods and attributes that return information
about the current page, session, or state.

## Router Attributes

The `self.router` attribute has several sub-attributes that provide various information:

* `router.page`: data about the current page and route
  * `host`: The hostname and port serving the current page (frontend).
  * `path`: The path of the current page (for dynamic pages, this will contain the slug)
  * `raw_path`: The path of the page displayed in the browser (including params and dynamic values)
  * `full_path`: `path` with `host` prefixed
  * `full_raw_path`: `raw_path` with `host` prefixed
  * `params`: Dictionary of query params associated with the request

* `router.session`: data about the current session
  * `client_token`: UUID associated with the current tab's token. Each tab has a unique token.
  * `session_id`: The ID associated with the client's websocket connection. Each tab has a unique session ID.
  * `client_ip`: The IP address of the client. Many users may share the same IP address.

* `router.headers`: headers associated with the websocket connection. These values can only change when the websocket is re-established (for example, during page refresh).
  * `host`: The hostname and port serving the websocket (backend).
  * `origin`: The origin of the request.
  * `upgrade`: The upgrade header for websocket connections.
  * `connection`: The connection header.
  * `cookie`: The cookie header.
  * `pragma`: The pragma header.
  * `cache_control`: The cache control header.
  * `user_agent`: The user agent string of the client.
  * `sec_websocket_version`: The websocket version.
  * `sec_websocket_key`: The websocket key.
  * `sec_websocket_extensions`: The websocket extensions.
  * `accept_encoding`: The accepted encodings.
  * `accept_language`: The accepted languages.
  * `raw_headers`: A mapping of all HTTP headers as a frozen dictionary. This provides access to any header that was sent with the request, not just the common ones listed above.

### Example Values on this Page

```python eval
rx.table.root(
        rx.table.header(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Value"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.table.body(
            *[
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.cell(item["name"], style=cell_style),
                    rx.table.cell(rx.code(item["value"], style=get_code_style("violet"))),
                )
                for item in router_data
            ]
        ),
        variant="surface",
        margin_y="1em",
    )
```

### Accessing Raw Headers

The `raw_headers` attribute provides access to all HTTP headers as a frozen dictionary. This is useful when you need to access headers that are not explicitly defined in the `HeaderData` class:

```python box
# Access a specific header
custom_header_value = self.router.headers.raw_headers.get("x-custom-header", "")

# Example of accessing common headers
user_agent = self.router.headers.raw_headers.get("user-agent", "")
content_type = self.router.headers.raw_headers.get("content-type", "")
authorization = self.router.headers.raw_headers.get("authorization", "")

# You can also check if a header exists
has_custom_header = "x-custom-header" in self.router.headers.raw_headers
```

This is particularly useful for accessing custom headers or when working with specific HTTP headers that are not part of the standard set exposed as direct attributes.


```python exec
from pcweb.pages.docs import custom_components
```

# Project Structure (Advanced)

## App Module

Reflex imports the main app module based on the `app_name` from the config, which **must define a module-level global named `app` as an instance of `rx.App`**.

The main app module is responsible for importing all other modules that make up the app and defining `app = rx.App()`.

**All other modules containing pages, state, and models MUST be imported by the main app module or package** for Reflex to include them in the compiled output.

# Breaking the App into Smaller Pieces

As applications scale, effective organization is crucial. This is achieved by breaking the application down into smaller, manageable modules and organizing them into logical packages that avoid circular dependencies.

In the following documentation there will be an app with an `app_name` of `example_big_app`. The main module would be `example_big_app/example_big_app.py`.

In the [Putting it all together](#putting-it-all-together) section there is a visual of the project folder structure to help follow along with the examples below.

### Pages Package: `example_big_app/pages`

All complex apps will have multiple pages, so it is recommended to create `example_big_app/pages` as a package.

1. This package should contain one module per page in the app.
2. If a particular page depends on the state, the substate should be defined in the same module as the page.
3. The page-returning function should be decorated with `rx.page()` to have it added as a route in the app.

```python
import reflex as rx

from ..state import AuthState


class LoginState(AuthState):
    @rx.event
    def handle_submit(self, form_data):
        self.logged_in = authenticate(form_data["username"], form_data["password"])


def login_field(name: str, **input_props):
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.text(name.capitalize()),
        rx.input(name=name, **input_props),
        width="100%",
        justify="between",
    )


@rx.page(route="/login")
def login():
    return rx.card(
        rx.form(
            rx.vstack(
                login_field("username"),
                login_field("password", type="password"),
                rx.button("Login"),
                width="100%",
                justify="center",
            ),
            on_submit=LoginState.handle_submit,
        ),
    )
```

### Templating: `example_big_app/template.py`

Most applications maintain a consistent layout and structure across pages. Defining this common structure in a separate module facilitates easy sharing and reuse when constructing individual pages.

**Best Practices**

1. Factor out common frontend UI elements into a function that returns a component.
2. If a function accepts a function that returns a component, it can be used as a decorator as seen below.

```python
from typing import Callable

import reflex as rx

from .components.menu import menu
from .components.navbar import navbar


def template(page: Callable[[], rx.Component]) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.vstack(
        navbar(),
        rx.hstack(
            menu(),
            rx.container(page()),
        ),
        width="100%",
    )
```

The `@template` decorator should appear below the `@rx.page` decorator and above the page-returning function. See the [Posts Page](#a-post-page-example_big_apppagespostspy) code for an example.

## State Management

Most pages will use State in some capacity. You should avoid adding vars to a
shared state that will only be used in a single page. Instead, define a new
subclass of `rx.State` and keep it in the same module as the page.

### Accessing other States

As of Reflex 0.4.3, any event handler can get access to an instance of any other
substate via the `get_state` API. From a practical perspective, this means that
state can be split up into smaller pieces without requiring a complex
inheritance hierarchy to share access to other states.

In previous releases, if an app wanted to store settings in `SettingsState` with
a page or component for modifying them, any other state with an event handler
that needed to access those settings would have to inherit from `SettingsState`,
even if the other state was mostly orthogonal. The other state would also now
always have to load the settings, even for event handlers that didn't need to
access them.

A better strategy is to load the desired state on demand from only the event
handler which needs access to the substate.

### A Settings Component: `example_big_app/components/settings.py`

```python
import reflex as rx


class SettingsState(rx.State):
    refresh_interval: int = 15
    auto_update: bool = True
    prefer_plain_text: bool = True
    posts_per_page: int = 20


def settings_dialog():
    return rx.dialog(...)
```

### A Post Page: `example_big_app/pages/posts.py`

This page loads the `SettingsState` to determine how many posts to display per page
and how often to refresh.

```python
import reflex as rx

from ..models import Post
from ..template import template
from ..components.settings import SettingsState


class PostsState(rx.State):
    refresh_tick: int
    page: int
    posts: list[Post]

    @rx.event
    async def on_load(self):
        settings = await self.get_state(SettingsState)
        if settings.auto_update:
            self.refresh_tick = settings.refresh_interval * 1000
        else:
            self.refresh_tick = 0

    @rx.event
    async def tick(self, _):
        settings = await self.get_state(SettingsState)
        with rx.session() as session:
            q = Post.select().offset(self.page * settings.posts_per_page).limit(settings.posts_per_page)
            self.posts = q.all()

    @rx.event
    def go_to_previous(self):
        if self.page > 0:
            self.page = self.page - 1

    @rx.event
    def go_to_next(self):
        if self.posts:
            self.page = self.page + 1


@rx.page(route="/posts", on_load=PostsState.on_load)
@template
def posts():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.foreach(PostsState.posts, post_view),
        rx.hstack(
            rx.button("< Prev", on_click=PostsState.go_to_previous),
            rx.button("Next >", on_click=PostsState.go_to_next),
            justify="between",
        ),
        rx.moment(interval=PostsState.refresh_tick, on_change=PostsState.tick, display="none"),
        width="100%",
    )
```

### Common State: `example_big_app/state.py`

_Common_ states and substates that are shared by multiple pages or components
should be implemented in a separate module to avoid circular imports. This
module should not import other modules in the app.

## Component Reusability

The primary mechanism for reusing components in Reflex is to define a function that returns
the component, then simply call it where that functionality is needed.

Component functions typically should not take any State classes as arguments, but prefer
to import the needed state and access the vars on the class directly.

### Memoize Functions for Improved Performance

In a large app, if a component has many subcomponents or is used in a large number of places, it can improve compile and runtime performance to memoize the function with the `@lru_cache` decorator.

To memoize the `foo` component to avoid re-creating it many times simply add `@lru_cache` to the function definition, and the component will only be created once per unique set of arguments.

```python
from functools import lru_cache

import reflex as rx

class State(rx.State):
    v: str = "foo"


@lru_cache
def foo():
    return rx.text(State.v)


def index():
    return rx.flex(
        rx.button("Change", on_click=State.set_v(rx.cond(State.v != "bar", "bar", "foo"))),
        *[
            foo()
            for _ in range(100)
        ],
        direction="row",
        wrap="wrap",
    )
```

### example_big_app/components

This package contains reusable parts of the app, for example headers, footers,
and menus. If a particular component requires state, the substate may be defined
in the same module for locality. Any substate defined in a component module
should only contain fields and event handlers pertaining to that individual
component.

### External Components

Reflex 0.4.3 introduced support for the [`reflex component` CLI commands]({custom_components.overview.path}), which makes it easy
to bundle up common functionality to publish on PyPI as a standalone Python package
that can be installed and used in any Reflex app.

When wrapping npm components or other self-contained bits of functionality, it can be helpful
to move this complexity outside the app itself for easier maintenance and reuse in other apps.

## Database Models: `example_big_app/models.py`

It is recommended to implement all database models in a single file to make it easier to define relationships and understand the entire schema.

However, if the schema is very large, it might make sense to have a `models` package with individual models defined in their own modules.

At any rate, defining the models separately allows any page or component to import and use them without circular imports.

## Top-level Package: `example_big_app/__init__.py`

This is a great place to import all state, models, and pages that should be part of the app.
Typically, components and helpers do not need to imported, because they will be imported by
pages that use them (or they would be unused).

```python
from . import state, models
from .pages import index, login, post, product, profile, schedule

__all__ = [
    "state",
    "models",
    "index",
    "login",
    "post",
    "product",
    "profile",
    "schedule",
]
```

If any pages are not imported here, they will not be compiled as part of the app.

## example_big_app/example_big_app.py

This is the main app module. Since everything else is defined in other modules, this file becomes very simple.

```python
import reflex as rx

app = rx.App()
```

## File Management

There are two categories of non-code assets (media, fonts, stylesheets,
documents) typically used in a Reflex app.

### assets

The `assets` directory is used for **static** files that should be accessible
relative to the root of the frontend (default port 3000). When an app is deployed in
production mode, changes to the assets directory will NOT be available at runtime!

When referencing an asset, always use a leading forward slash, so the
asset can be resolved regardless of the page route where it may appear.

### uploaded_files

If an app needs to make files available dynamically at runtime, it is
recommended to set the target directory via `REFLEX_UPLOADED_FILES_DIR`
environment variable (default `./uploaded_files`), write files relative to the
path returned by `rx.get_upload_dir()`, and create working links via
`rx.get_upload_url(relative_path)`.

Uploaded files are served from the backend (default port 8000) via
`/_upload/<relative_path>`

## Putting it all together

Based on the previous discussion, the recommended project layout look like this.

```text
example-big-app/
├─ assets/
├─ example_big_app/
│  ├─ components/
│  │  ├─ __init__.py
│  │  ├─ auth.py
│  │  ├─ footer.py
│  │  ├─ menu.py
│  │  ├─ navbar.py
│  ├─ pages/
│  │  ├─ __init__.py
│  │  ├─ index.py
│  │  ├─ login.py
│  │  ├─ posts.py
│  │  ├─ product.py
│  │  ├─ profile.py
│  │  ├─ schedule.py
│  ├─ __init__.py
│  ├─ example_big_app.py
│  ├─ models.py
│  ├─ state.py
│  ├─ template.py
├─ uploaded_files/
├─ requirements.txt
├─ rxconfig.py
```

## Key Takeaways

- Like any other Python project, **split up the app into modules and packages** to keep the codebase organized and manageable.
- Using smaller modules and packages makes it easier to **reuse components and state** across the app
  without introducing circular dependencies.
- Create **individual functions** to encapsulate units of functionality and **reuse them** where needed.


```python exec
from pcweb.pages.docs import api_reference
```

# Configuration

Reflex apps can be configured using a configuration file, environment variables, and command line arguments.

## Configuration File

Running `reflex init` will create an `rxconfig.py` file in your root directory.
You can pass keyword arguments to the `Config` class to configure your app.

For example:

```python
# rxconfig.py
import reflex as rx

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="my_app_name",
    # Connect to your own database.
    db_url="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/my_db",
    # Change the frontend port.
    frontend_port=3001,
)
```

See the [config reference]({api_reference.config.path}) for all the parameters available.

## Environment Variables

You can override the configuration file by setting environment variables.
For example, to override the `frontend_port` setting, you can set the `FRONTEND_PORT` environment variable.

```bash
FRONTEND_PORT=3001 reflex run
```

## Command Line Arguments

Finally, you can override the configuration file and environment variables by passing command line arguments to `reflex run`.

```bash
reflex run --frontend-port 3001
```

See the [CLI reference]({api_reference.cli.path}) for all the arguments available.

## Customizable App Data Directory

The `REFLEX_DIR` environment variable can be set, which allows users to set the location where Reflex writes helper tools like Bun and NodeJS.

By default we use Platform specific directories:

On windows, `C:/Users/<username>/AppData/Local/reflex` is used.

On macOS, `~/Library/Application Support/reflex` is used.

On linux, `~/.local/share/reflex` is used.


```python exec
from pcweb import constants
from pcweb.pages.docs import wrapping_react, custom_components, styling, events
from pcweb.pages.docs.custom_components import custom_components as cc
```

# How Reflex Works

We'll use the following basic app that displays Github profile images as an example to explain the different parts of the architecture.

```python demo exec
import requests
import reflex as rx

class GithubState(rx.State):
    url: str = "https://github.com/reflex-dev"
    profile_image: str = "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104714959"

    @rx.event
    def set_profile(self, username: str):
        if username == "":
            return
        try:
            github_data = requests.get(f"https://api.github.com/users/{username}").json()
        except:
            return
        self.url = github_data["url"]
        self.profile_image = github_data["avatar_url"]

def index():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.link(
            rx.avatar(src=GithubState.profile_image),
            href=GithubState.url,
        ),
        rx.input(
            placeholder="Your Github username",
            on_blur=GithubState.set_profile,
        ),
    )
```

## The Reflex Architecture

Full-stack web apps are made up of a frontend and a backend. The frontend is the user interface, and is served as a web page that runs on the user's browser. The backend handles the logic and state management (such as databases and APIs), and is run on a server.

In traditional web development, these are usually two separate apps, and are often written in different frameworks or languages. For example, you may combine a Flask backend with a React frontend. With this approach, you have to maintain two separate apps and end up writing a lot of boilerplate code to connect the frontend and backend.

We wanted to simplify this process in Reflex by defining both the frontend and backend in a single codebase, while using Python for everything. Developers should only worry about their app's logic and not about the low-level implementation details.

### TLDR

Under the hood, Reflex apps compile down to a [React](https://react.dev) frontend app and a [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) backend app. Only the UI is compiled to Javascript; all the app logic and state management stays in Python and is run on the server. Reflex uses [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) to send events from the frontend to the backend, and to send state updates from the backend to the frontend.

The diagram below provides a detailed overview of how a Reflex app works. We'll go through each part in more detail in the following sections.

```python exec
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
```

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/architecture.png"))
```

```python eval
rx.box(height="1em")
```

## Frontend

We wanted Reflex apps to look and feel like a traditional web app to the end user, while still being easy to build and maintain for the developer. To do this, we built on top of mature and popular web technologies.

When you `reflex run` your app, Reflex compiles the frontend down to a single-page [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app and serves it on a port (by default `3000`) that you can access in your browser.

The frontend's job is to reflect the app's state, and send events to the backend when the user interacts with the UI. No actual logic is run on the frontend.

### Components

Reflex frontends are built using components that can be composed together to create complex UIs. Instead of using a templating language that mixes HTML and Python, we just use Python functions to define the UI.

```python
def index():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.link(
            rx.avatar(src=GithubState.profile_image),
            href=GithubState.url,
        ),
        rx.input(
            placeholder="Your Github username",
            on_blur=GithubState.set_profile,
        ),
    )
```

In our example app, we have components such as `rx.hstack`, `rx.avatar`, and `rx.input`. These components can have different **props** that affect their appearance and functionality - for example the `rx.input` component has a `placeholder` prop to display the default text.

We can make our components respond to user interactions with events such as `on_blur`, which we will discuss more below.

Under the hood, these components compile down to React components. For example, the above code compiles down to the following React code:

```jsx
<HStack>
    <Link href=\{GithubState.url}>
        <Avatar src=\{GithubState.profile_image}/>
    </Link>
    <Input
        placeholder="Your Github username"
        // This would actually be a websocket call to the backend.
        onBlur=\{GithubState.set_profile}
    >
</HStack>
```

Many of our core components are based on [Radix](https://radix-ui.com/), a popular React component library. We also have many other components for graphing, datatables, and more.

We chose React because it is a popular library with a huge ecosystem. Our goal isn't to recreate the web ecosystem, but to make it accessible to Python developers.

This also lets our users bring their own components if we don't have a component they need. Users can [wrap their own React components]({wrapping_react.overview.path}) and then [publish them]({custom_components.overview.path}) for others to use. Over time we will build out our [third party component ecosystem]({cc.path}) so that users can easily find and use components that others have built.

### Styling

We wanted to make sure Reflex apps look good out of the box, while still giving developers full control over the appearance of their app.

We have a core [theming system]({styling.theming.path}) that lets you set high level styling options such as dark mode and accent color throughout your app to give it a unified look and feel.

Beyond this, Reflex components can be styled using the full power of CSS. We leverage the [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) library to allow "CSS-in-Python" styling, so you can pass any CSS prop as a keyword argument to a component. This includes [responsive props]({styling.responsive.path}) by passing a list of values.

## Backend

Now let's look at how we added interactivity to our apps.

In Reflex only the frontend compiles to Javascript and runs on the user's browser, while all the state and logic stays in Python and is run on the server. When you `reflex run`, we start a FastAPI server (by default on port `8000`) that the frontend connects to through a websocket.

All the state and logic are defined within a `State` class.

```python
class GithubState(rx.State):
    url: str = "https://github.com/reflex-dev"
    profile_image: str = "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104714959"

    def set_profile(self, username: str):
        if username == "":
            return
        github_data = requests.get(f"https://api.github.com/users/\{username}").json()
        self.url = github_data["url"]
        self.profile_image = github_data["avatar_url"]
```

The state is made up of **vars** and **event handlers**.

Vars are any values in your app that can change over time. They are defined as class attributes on your `State` class, and may be any Python type that can be serialized to JSON. In our example, `url` and `profile_image` are vars.

Event handlers are methods in your `State` class that are called when the user interacts with the UI. They are the only way that we can modify the vars in Reflex, and can be called in response to user actions, such as clicking a button or typing in a text box. In our example, `set_profile` is an event handler that updates the `url` and `profile_image` vars.

Since event handlers are run on the backend, you can use any Python library within them. In our example, we use the `requests` library to make an API call to Github to get the user's profile image.

## Event Processing

Now we get into the interesting part - how we handle events and state updates.

Normally when writing web apps, you have to write a lot of boilerplate code to connect the frontend and backend. With Reflex, you don't have to worry about that - we handle the communication between the frontend and backend for you. Developers just have to write their event handler logic, and when the vars are updated the UI is automatically updated.

You can refer to the diagram above for a visual representation of the process. Let's walk through it with our Github profile image example.

### Event Triggers

The user can interact with the UI in many ways, such as clicking a button, typing in a text box, or hovering over an element. In Reflex, we call these **event triggers**.

```python
rx.input(
    placeholder="Your Github username",
    on_blur=GithubState.set_profile,
)
```

In our example we bind the `on_blur` event trigger to the `set_profile` event handler. This means that when the user types in the input field and then clicks away, the `set_profile` event handler is called.

### Event Queue

On the frontend, we maintain an event queue of all pending events. An event consists of three major pieces of data:

- **client token**: Each client (browser tab) has a unique token to identify it. This let's the backend know which state to update.
- **event handler**: The event handler to run on the state.
- **arguments**: The arguments to pass to the event handler.

Let's assume I type my username "picklelo" into the input. In this example, our event would look something like this:

```json
{
  "client_token": "abc123",
  "event_handler": "GithubState.set_profile",
  "arguments": ["picklelo"]
}
```

On the frontend, we maintain an event queue of all pending events.

When an event is triggered, it is added to the queue. We have a `processing` flag to make sure only one event is processed at a time. This ensures that the state is always consistent and there aren't any race conditions with two event handlers modifying the state at the same time.

```md alert info
# There are exceptions to this, such as [background events]({events.background_events.path}) which allow you to run events in the background without blocking the UI.
```

Once the event is ready to be processed, it is sent to the backend through a WebSocket connection.

### State Manager

Once the event is received, it is processed on the backend.

Reflex uses a **state manager** which maintains a mapping between client tokens and their state. By default, the state manager is just an in-memory dictionary, but it can be extended to use a database or cache. In production we use Redis as our state manager.

### Event Handling

Once we have the user's state, the next step is to run the event handler with the arguments.

```python
 def set_profile(self, username: str):
    if username == "":
        return
    github_data = requests.get(f"https://api.github.com/users/\{username}").json()
    self.url = github_data["url"]
    self.profile_image = github_data["avatar_url"]
```

In our example, the `set_profile` event handler is run on the user's state. This makes an API call to Github to get the user's profile image, and then updates the state's `url` and `profile_image` vars.

### State Updates

Every time an event handler returns (or [yields]({events.yield_events.path})), we save the state in the state manager and send the **state updates** to the frontend to update the UI.

To maintain performance as your state grows, internally Reflex keeps track of vars that were updated during the event handler (**dirty vars**). When the event handler is done processing, we find all the dirty vars and create a state update to send to the frontend.

In our case, the state update may look something like this:

```json
{
  "url": "https://github.com/picklelo",
  "profile_image": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104714959"
}
```

We store the new state in our state manager, and then send the state update to the frontend. The frontend then updates the UI to reflect the new state. In our example, the new Github profile image is displayed.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb import constants, styles
from pcweb.pages import docs
from pcweb.pages.docs import api_reference, library
```

# Pages

Pages map components to different URLs in your app. This section covers creating pages, handling URL arguments, accessing query parameters, managing page metadata, and handling page load events.

## Adding a Page

You can create a page by defining a function that returns a component.
By default, the function name will be used as the route, but you can also specify a route.

```python
def index():
    return rx.text('Root Page')

def about():
    return rx.text('About Page')


def custom():
    return rx.text('Custom Route')

app = rx.App()

app.add_page(index)
app.add_page(about)
app.add_page(custom, route="/custom-route")
```

In this example we create three pages:

- `index` - The root route, available at `/`
- `about` - available at `/about`
- `custom` - available at `/custom-route`

```md alert
# Index is a special exception where it is available at both `/` and `/index`. All other pages are only available at their specified route.
```

```md video https://youtube.com/embed/ITOZkzjtjUA?start=3853&end=4083
# Video: Pages and URL Routes
```

## Page Decorator

You can also use the `@rx.page` decorator to add a page.

```python
@rx.page(route='/', title='My Beautiful App')
def index():
    return rx.text('A Beautiful App')
```

This is equivalent to calling `app.add_page` with the same arguments.

```md alert warning
# Remember to import the modules defining your decorated pages.

This is necessary for the pages to be registered with the app.

You can directly import the module or import another module that imports the decorated pages.
```

## Navigating Between Pages

### Links

[Links]({library.typography.link.path}) are accessible elements used primarily for navigation. Use the `href` prop to specify the location for the link to navigate to.

```python demo
rx.link("Reflex Home Page.", href="https://reflex.dev/")
```

You can also provide local links to other pages in your project without writing the full url.

```python demo
rx.link("Example", href="/docs/library")
```

To open the link in a new tab, set the `is_external` prop to `True`.

```python demo
rx.link("Open in new tab", href="https://reflex.dev/", is_external=True)
```

Check out the [link docs]({library.typography.link.path}) to learn more.

```md video https://youtube.com/embed/ITOZkzjtjUA?start=4083&end=4423
# Video: Link-based Navigation
```

### Redirect

Redirect the user to a new path within the application using `rx.redirect()`.

- `path`: The destination path or URL to which the user should be redirected.
- `external`: If set to True, the redirection will open in a new tab. Defaults to `False`.

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.button("open in tab", on_click=rx.redirect("/docs/api-reference/special_events")),
    rx.button("open in new tab", on_click=rx.redirect('https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex/', is_external=True))
)
```

Redirect can also be run from an event handler in State, meaning logic can be added behind it. It is necessary to `return` the `rx.redirect()`.

```python demo exec
class Redirect2ExampleState(rx.State):
    redirect_to_org: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def change_redirect(self):
        self.redirect_to_org = not self.redirect_to_org

    @rx.var
    def url(self) -> str:
        return 'https://github.com/reflex-dev/' if self.redirect_to_org else 'https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex/'

    @rx.event
    def change_page(self):
        return rx.redirect(self.url, is_external=True)

def redirect_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text(f"{Redirect2ExampleState.url}"),
        rx.button("Change redirect location", on_click=Redirect2ExampleState.change_redirect),
        rx.button("Redirect to new page in State", on_click=Redirect2ExampleState.change_page),

    )
```

```md video https://youtube.com/embed/ITOZkzjtjUA?start=4423&end=4903
# Video: Redirecting to a New Page
```

## Nested Routes

Pages can also have nested routes.

```python
def nested_page():
    return rx.text('Nested Page')

app = rx.App()
app.add_page(nested_page, route='/nested/page')
```

This component will be available at `/nested/page`.

## Page Metadata

```python exec

import reflex as rx

meta_data = (
"""
@rx.page(
    title='My Beautiful App',
    description='A beautiful app built with Reflex',
    image='/splash.png',
    meta=meta,
)
def index():
    return rx.text('A Beautiful App')

@rx.page(title='About Page')
def about():
    return rx.text('About Page')


meta = [
    {'name': 'theme_color', 'content': '#FFFFFF'},
    {'char_set': 'UTF-8'},
    {'property': 'og:url', 'content': 'url'},
]

app = rx.App()
"""  

)

```

You can add page metadata such as:

- The title to be shown in the browser tab
- The description as shown in search results
- The preview image to be shown when the page is shared on social media
- Any additional metadata

```python
{meta_data}
```

## Getting the Current Page

You can access the current page from the `router` attribute in any state. See the [router docs]({docs.utility_methods.router_attributes.path}) for all available attributes.

```python
class State(rx.State):
    def some_method(self):
        current_page_route = self.router.page.path
        current_page_url = self.router.page.raw_path
        # ... Your logic here ...
```

The `router.page.path` attribute allows you to obtain the path of the current page from the router data,
for [dynamic pages]({docs.pages.dynamic_routing.path}) this will contain the slug rather than the actual value used to load the page.

To get the actual URL displayed in the browser, use `router.page.raw_path`. This
will contain all query parameters and dynamic path segments.


In the above example, `current_page_route` will contain the route pattern (e.g., `/posts/[id]`), while `current_page_url`
will contain the actual URL (e.g., `/posts/123`).

To get the full URL, access the same attributes with `full_` prefix.

Example:

```python
class State(rx.State):
    @rx.var
    def current_url(self) -> str:
        return self.router.page.full_raw_path

def index():
    return rx.text(State.current_url)

app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index, route='/posts/[id]')
```

In this example, running on `localhost` should display `http://localhost:3000/posts/123/`


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb import constants, styles
```

# Dynamic Routes

Dynamic routes in Reflex allow you to handle varying URL structures, enabling you to create flexible
and adaptable web applications. This section covers regular dynamic routes, catch-all routes,
and optional catch-all routes, each with detailed examples.

## Regular Dynamic Routes

Regular dynamic routes in Reflex allow you to match specific segments in a URL dynamically. A regular dynamic route is defined by square brackets in a route string / url pattern. For example `/users/[id]` or `/products/[category]`. These dynamic route arguments can be accessed through a state var. For the examples above they would be `rx.State.id` and `rx.State.category` respectively.

```md alert info
# Why is the state var accessed as `rx.State.id`?

The dynamic route arguments are accessible as `rx.State.id` and `rx.State.category` here as the var is added to the root state, so that it is accessible from any state.
```

Example:

```python
@rx.page(route='/post/[pid]')
def post():
    '''A page that updates based on the route.'''
    # Displays the dynamic part of the URL, the post ID
    return rx.heading(rx.State.pid)

app = rx.App()
```

The [pid] part in the route is a dynamic segment, meaning it can match any value provided in the URL. For instance, `/post/5`, `/post/10`, or `/post/abc` would all match this route.

If a user navigates to `/post/5`, `State.post_id` will return `5`, and the page will display `5` as the heading. If the URL is `/post/xyz`, it will display `xyz`. If the URL is `/post/` without any additional parameter, it will display `""`.

### Adding Dynamic Routes

Adding dynamic routes uses the `add_page` method like any other page. The only difference is that the route string contains dynamic segments enclosed in square brackets.

If you are using the `app.add_page` method to define pages, it is necessary to add the dynamic routes first, especially if they use the same function as a non dynamic route.

For example the code snippet below will:

```python
app.add_page(index, route="/page/[page_id]", on_load=DynamicState.on_load)
app.add_page(index, route="/static/x", on_load=DynamicState.on_load)
app.add_page(index)
```

But if we switch the order of adding the pages, like in the example below, it will not work:

```python
app.add_page(index, route="/static/x", on_load=DynamicState.on_load)
app.add_page(index)
app.add_page(index, route="/page/[page_id]", on_load=DynamicState.on_load)
```

## Catch-All Routes

Catch-all routes in Reflex allow you to match any number of segments in a URL dynamically.

Example:

```python
class State(rx.State):
    @rx.var
    def user_post(self) -> str:
        args = self.router.page.params
        usernames = args.get('splat', [])
        return f"Posts by \{', '.join(usernames)}"

@rx.page(route='/users/[id]/posts/[[...splat]]')
def post():
    return rx.center(
        rx.text(State.user_post)
    )


app = rx.App()
```

In this case, the `...splat` catch-all pattern captures any number of segments after
`/users/`, allowing URLs like `/users/2/posts/john/` and `/users/1/posts/john/doe/` to match the route.

```md alert
# Catch-all routes must be named `splat` and be placed at the end of the URL pattern to ensure proper route matching.
```

### Routes Validation Table

## An example: Make it count

Here, we go over a simple counter app that lets the user count up or down.

```python exec
class CounterExampleState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1

    def decrement(self):
        self.count -= 1

class IntroTabsState(rx.State):
    """The app state."""

    value = "tab1"
    tab_selected = ""

    def change_value(self, val):
        self.tab_selected = f"{val} clicked!"
        self.value = val

def tabs():
    return rx.tabs.root(
        rx.tabs.list(
            rx.tabs.trigger(
                "Frontend", value="tab1",
                class_name="tab-style"
            ),
            rx.tabs.trigger(
                "Backend", value="tab2",
                class_name="tab-style"
            ),

```

## The Structure of a Reflex App

Let's break this example down.

### Import

```python
import reflex as rx
```

We begin by importing the `reflex` package (aliased to `rx`). We reference Reflex objects as `rx.*` by convention.

### State

```python
class State(rx.State):
    count: int = 0
```

The state defines all the variables (called **[vars]({vars.base_vars.path})**) in an app that can change, as well as the functions (called **[event_handlers](#event-handlers)**) that change them.

Here our state has a single var, `count`, which holds the current value of the counter. We initialize it to `0`.

### Event Handlers

```python
def increment(self):
    self.count += 1

def decrement(self):
    self.count -= 1
```

Within the state, we define functions, called **event handlers**, that change the state vars.

Event handlers are the only way that we can modify the state in Reflex.
They can be called in response to user actions, such as clicking a button or typing in a text box.
These actions are called **events**.

Our counter app has two event handlers, `increment` and `decrement`.

### User Interface (UI)

```python
def index():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.button(
            "Decrement",
            color_scheme="ruby",
            on_click=State.decrement,
        ),
        rx.heading(State.count, font_size="2em"),
        rx.button(
            "Increment",
            color_scheme="grass",
            on_click=State.increment,
        ),
        spacing="4",
    )
```

This function defines the app's user interface.

We use different components such as `rx.hstack`, `rx.button`, and `rx.heading` to build the frontend. Components can be nested to create complex layouts, and can be styled using the full power of CSS.

Reflex comes with [50+ built-in components]({library.path}) to help you get started.
We are actively adding more components. Also, it's easy to [wrap your own React components]({wrapping_react.overview.path}).

```python
rx.heading(State.count, font_size="2em"),
```

Components can reference the app's state vars.
The `rx.heading` component displays the current value of the counter by referencing `State.count`.
All components that reference state will reactively update whenever the state changes.

```python
rx.button(
    "Decrement",
    color_scheme="ruby",
    on_click=State.decrement,
),
```

Components interact with the state by binding events triggers to event handlers.
For example, `on_click` is an event that is triggered when a user clicks a component.

The first button in our app binds its `on_click` event to the `State.decrement` event handler. Similarly the second button binds `on_click` to `State.increment`.

In other words, the sequence goes like this:

- User clicks "increment" on the UI.
- `on_click` event is triggered.
- Event handler `State.increment` is called.
- `State.count` is incremented.
- UI updates to reflect the new value of `State.count`.

### Add pages

Next we define our app and add the counter component to the base route.

```python
app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index)
```

## Next Steps

🎉 And that's it!

We've created a simple, yet fully interactive web app in pure Python.

By continuing with our documentation, you will learn how to build awesome apps with Reflex.

# Interactive Tutorial: AI Chat App

This tutorial will walk you through building an AI chat app with Reflex. This app is fairly complex, but don't worry - we'll break it down into small steps.

You can find the full source code for this app [here]({CHAT_APP_URL}).

### What You'll Learn

In this tutorial you'll learn how to:

1. Install `reflex` and set up your development environment.
2. Create components to define and style your UI.
3. Use state to add interactivity to your app.
4. Deploy your app to share with others.




## Setting up Your Project

```md video https://youtube.com/embed/ITOZkzjtjUA?start=175&end=445
# Video: Example of Setting up the Chat App
```

We will start by creating a new project and setting up our development environment. First, create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.

```bash
~ $ mkdir chatapp
~ $ cd chatapp
```

Next, we will create a virtual environment for our project. This is optional, but recommended. In this example, we will use [venv]({constants.VENV_URL}) to create our virtual environment.

```bash
chatapp $ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Now, we will install Reflex and create a new project. This will create a new directory structure in our project directory.

> **Note:** When prompted to select a template, choose option 0 for a blank project.


```bash
chatapp $ pip install reflex
chatapp $ reflex init
────────────────────────────────── Initializing chatapp ───────────────────────────────────
Success: Initialized chatapp
chatapp $ ls
assets          chatapp         rxconfig.py     venv
```

```python eval
rx.box(height="20px")
```
You can run the template app to make sure everything is working.

```bash
chatapp $ reflex run
─────────────────────────────────── Starting Reflex App ───────────────────────────────────
Compiling:  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% 1/1 0:00:00
─────────────────────────────────────── App Running ───────────────────────────────────────
App running at: http://localhost:3000
```

```python eval
rx.box(height="20px")
```

You should see your app running at [http://localhost:3000]({"http://localhost:3000"}).

Reflex also starts the backend server which handles all the state management and communication with the frontend. You can test the backend server is running by navigating to [http://localhost:8000/ping]({"http://localhost:8000/ping"}).

Now that we have our project set up, in the next section we will start building our app!




## Basic Frontend

Let's start with defining the frontend for our chat app. In Reflex, the frontend can be broken down into independent, reusable components. See the [components docs]({components.props.path}) for more information.

### Display A Question And Answer

We will modify the `index` function in `chatapp/chatapp.py` file to return a component that displays a single question and answer.

```python demo box
rx.container(
    rx.box(
        "What is Reflex?",
        # The user's question is on the right.
        text_align="right",
    ),
    rx.box(
        "A way to build web apps in pure Python!",
        # The answer is on the left.
        text_align="left",
    ),
)
```

```python
# chatapp.py

import reflex as rx

def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.container(
        rx.box(
            "What is Reflex?",
            # The user's question is on the right.
            text_align="right",
        ),
        rx.box(
            "A way to build web apps in pure Python!",
            # The answer is on the left.
            text_align="left",
        ),
    )


# Add state and page to the app.
app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index)
```

Components can be nested inside each other to create complex layouts. Here we create a parent container that contains two boxes for the question and answer.

We also add some basic styling to the components. Components take in keyword arguments, called [props]({components.props.path}), that modify the appearance and functionality of the component. We use the `text_align` prop to align the text to the left and right.

### Reusing Components

Now that we have a component that displays a single question and answer, we can reuse it to display multiple questions and answers. We will move the component to a separate function `question_answer` and call it from the `index` function.

```python exec
def qa(question: str, answer: str) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.box(
        rx.box(question, text_align="right"),
        rx.box(answer, text_align="left"),
        margin_y="1em",
    )


qa_pairs = [
    ("What is Reflex?", "A way to build web apps in pure Python!"),
    (
        "What can I make with it?",
        "Anything from a simple website to a complex web app!",
    ),
]


def chat() -> rx.Component:
    qa_pairs = [
        ("What is Reflex?", "A way to build web apps in pure Python!"),
        (
            "What can I make with it?",
            "Anything from a simple website to a complex web app!",
        ),
    ]
    return rx.box(*[qa(question, answer) for question, answer in qa_pairs])
```

```python demo box
rx.container(chat())
```

```python
def qa(question: str, answer: str) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.box(
        rx.box(question, text_align="right"),
        rx.box(answer, text_align="left"),
        margin_y="1em",
    )


def chat() -> rx.Component:
    qa_pairs = [
        ("What is Reflex?", "A way to build web apps in pure Python!"),
        ("What can I make with it?", "Anything from a simple website to a complex web app!"),
    ]
    return rx.box(*[qa(question, answer) for question, answer in qa_pairs])


def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.container(chat())
```

### Chat Input

Now we want a way for the user to input a question. For this, we will use the [input]({library.forms.input.path}) component to have the user add text and a [button]({library.forms.button.path}) component to submit the question.

```python exec
def action_bar() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.input(placeholder="Ask a question"),
        rx.button("Ask"),
    )
```

```python demo box
rx.container(
    chat(),
    action_bar(),
)
```

```python
def action_bar() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.input(placeholder="Ask a question"),
        rx.button("Ask"),
    )

def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.container(
        chat(),
        action_bar(),
    )
```

### Styling

Let's add some styling to the app. More information on styling can be found in the [styling docs]({styling.overview.path}). To keep our code clean, we will move the styling to a separate file `chatapp/style.py`.

```python
# style.py
import reflex as rx

# Common styles for questions and answers.
shadow = "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15) 0px 2px 8px"
chat_margin = "20%"
message_style = dict(
    padding="1em",
    border_radius="5px",
    margin_y="0.5em",
    box_shadow=shadow,
    max_width="30em",
    display="inline-block",
)

# Set specific styles for questions and answers.
question_style = message_style | dict(margin_left=chat_margin, background_color=rx.color("gray", 4))
answer_style = message_style | dict(margin_right=chat_margin, background_color=rx.color("accent", 8))

# Styles for the action bar.
input_style = dict(
    border_width="1px", padding="0.5em", box_shadow=shadow,width="350px"
)
button_style = dict(background_color=rx.color("accent", 10), box_shadow=shadow)
```

We will import the styles in `chatapp.py` and use them in the components. At this point, the app should look like this:

```python exec
def qa4(question: str, answer: str) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.box(
        rx.box(rx.text(question, style=style.question_style), text_align="right"),
        rx.box(rx.text(answer, style=style.answer_style), text_align="left"),
        margin_y="1em",
        width="100%",
    )


def chat4() -> rx.Component:
    qa_pairs = [
        ("What is Reflex?", "A way to build web apps in pure Python!"),
        (
            "What can I make with it?",
            "Anything from a simple website to a complex web app!",
        ),
    ]
    return rx.box(*[qa4(question, answer) for question, answer in qa_pairs])


def action_bar4() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.input(placeholder="Ask a question", style=style.input_style),
        rx.button("Ask", style=style.button_style),
    )
```

```python demo box
rx.center(
    rx.vstack(
        chat4(),
        action_bar4(),
        align="center",
    )
)
```

```python
# chatapp.py
import reflex as rx

from chatapp import style


def qa(question: str, answer: str) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.box(
        rx.box(rx.text(question, style=style.question_style), text_align="right"),
        rx.box(rx.text(answer, style=style.answer_style), text_align="left"),
        margin_y="1em",
        width="100%",
    )

def chat() -> rx.Component:
    qa_pairs = [
        ("What is Reflex?", "A way to build web apps in pure Python!"),
        ("What can I make with it?", "Anything from a simple website to a complex web app!"),
    ]
    return rx.box(*[qa(question, answer) for question, answer in qa_pairs])


def action_bar() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.input(placeholder="Ask a question", style=style.input_style),
        rx.button("Ask", style=style.button_style),
    )


def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.center(
        rx.vstack(
            chat(),
            action_bar(),
            align="center",
        )
    )


app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index)
```

The app is looking good, but it's not very useful yet! In the next section, we will add some functionality to the app.






## State

Now let’s make the chat app interactive by adding state. The state is where we define all the variables that can change in the app and all the functions that can modify them. You can learn more about state in the [state docs]({state.overview.path}).

### Defining State

We will create a new file called `state.py` in the `chatapp` directory. Our state will keep track of the current question being asked and the chat history. We will also define an event handler `answer` which will process the current question and add the answer to the chat history.

```python
# state.py
import reflex as rx


class State(rx.State):

    # The current question being asked.
    question: str

    # Keep track of the chat history as a list of (question, answer) tuples.
    chat_history: list[tuple[str, str]]

    @rx.event
    def answer(self):
        # Our chatbot is not very smart right now...
        answer = "I don't know!"
        self.chat_history.append((self.question, answer))

```

### Binding State to Components

Now we can import the state in `chatapp.py` and reference it in our frontend components. We will modify the `chat` component to use the state instead of the current fixed questions and answers.

```python exec
def qa(question: str, answer: str) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.box(
        rx.box(rx.text(question, style=style.question_style), text_align="right"),
        rx.box(rx.text(answer, style=style.answer_style), text_align="left"),
        margin_y="1em",
        width="100%",
    )


def chat1() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.box(
        rx.foreach(
            ChatappState.chat_history, lambda messages: qa(messages[0], messages[1])
        )
    )


def action_bar1() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.input(
            placeholder="Ask a question",
            on_change=ChatappState.set_question,
            style=style.input_style,
        ),
        rx.button("Ask", on_click=ChatappState.answer, style=style.button_style),
    )
```

```python demo box
rx.container(
    chat1(),
    action_bar1(),
)
```

```python
# chatapp.py
from chatapp.state import State


def chat() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.box(
        rx.foreach(
            State.chat_history,
            lambda messages: qa(messages[0], messages[1])
        )
    )



def action_bar() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.input(placeholder="Ask a question", on_change=State.set_question1, style=style.input_style),
        rx.button("Ask", on_click=State.answer, style=style.button_style),
    )
```

Normal Python `for` loops don't work for iterating over state vars because these values can change and aren't known at compile time. Instead, we use the [foreach]({library.dynamic_rendering.foreach.path}) component to iterate over the chat history.

We also bind the input's `on_change` event to the `set_question` event handler, which will update the `question` state var while the user types in the input. We bind the button's `on_click` event to the `answer` event handler, which will process the question and add the answer to the chat history. The `set_question` event handler is a built-in implicitly defined event handler. Every base var has one. Learn more in the [events docs]({events.setters.path}) under the Setters section.

### Clearing the Input

Currently the input doesn't clear after the user clicks the button. We can fix this by binding the value of the input to `question`, with `value=State.question`, and clear it when we run the event handler for `answer`, with `self.question = ''`.

```python exec
def action_bar2() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.input(
            value=ChatappState.question,
            placeholder="Ask a question",
            on_change=ChatappState.set_question,
            style=style.input_style,
        ),
        rx.button("Ask", on_click=ChatappState.answer2, style=style.button_style),
    )
```

```python demo box
rx.container(
    chat1(),
    action_bar2(),
)
```

```python
# chatapp.py
def action_bar() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.input(
            value=State.question,
            placeholder="Ask a question",
            on_change=State.set_question2,
            style=style.input_style),
        rx.button("Ask", on_click=State.answer, style=style.button_style),
    )
```

```python
# state.py
@rx.event
def answer(self):
    # Our chatbot is not very smart right now...
    answer = "I don't know!"
    self.chat_history.append((self.question, answer))
    self.question = ""
```

### Streaming Text

Normally state updates are sent to the frontend when an event handler returns. However, we want to stream the text from the chatbot as it is generated. We can do this by yielding from the event handler. See the [yield events docs]({events.yield_events.path}) for more info.

```python exec
def action_bar3() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.input(
            value=ChatappState.question,
            placeholder="Ask a question",
            on_change=ChatappState.set_question,
            style=style.input_style,
        ),
        rx.button("Ask", on_click=ChatappState.answer3, style=style.button_style),
    )
```

```python demo box
rx.container(
    chat1(),
    action_bar3(),
)
```

```python
# state.py
import asyncio

async def answer(self):
    # Our chatbot is not very smart right now...
    answer = "I don't know!"
    self.chat_history.append((self.question, ""))

    # Clear the question input.
    self.question = ""
    # Yield here to clear the frontend input before continuing.
    yield

    for i in range(len(answer)):
        # Pause to show the streaming effect.
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        # Add one letter at a time to the output.
        self.chat_history[-1] = (self.chat_history[-1][0], answer[:i + 1])
        yield
```

In the next section, we will finish our chatbot by adding AI!



## Final App

We will use OpenAI's API to give our chatbot some intelligence.

### Configure the OpenAI API Key

First, ensure you have an active OpenAI subscription.
Next, install the latest openai package:
```bash
pip install --upgrade openai
```

Direct Configuration of API in Code

Update the state.py file to include your API key directly:

```python
# state.py
import os
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

import reflex as rx

# Initialize the OpenAI client
client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")  # Replace with your actual API key

```

### Using the API

Making your chatbot intelligent requires connecting to a language model API. This section explains how to integrate with OpenAI's API to power your chatbot's responses.

1. First, the user types a prompt that is updated via the `on_change` event handler.
2. Next, when a prompt is ready, the user can choose to submit it by clicking the `Ask` button which in turn triggers the `State.answer` method inside our `state.py` file.
3. Finally, if the method is triggered, the `prompt` is sent via a request to OpenAI client and returns an answer that we can trim and use to update the chat history!


```python
# chatapp.py
def action_bar() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.input(
            value=State.question,
            placeholder="Ask a question",
            # on_change event updates the input as the user types a prompt.
            on_change=State.set_question3,
            style=style.input_style),

        # on_click event triggers the API to send the prompt to OpenAI.
        rx.button("Ask", on_click=State.answer, style=style.button_style),
    )
```

```python
# state.py
import os

from openai import AsyncOpenAI

@rx.event
async def answer(self):
    # Our chatbot has some brains now!
    client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

    session = await client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            \{"role": "user", "content": self.question}
        ],
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
        stream=True,
    )

    # Add to the answer as the chatbot responds.
    answer = ""
    self.chat_history.append((self.question, answer))

    # Clear the question input.
    self.question = ""
    # Yield here to clear the frontend input before continuing.
    yield

    async for item in session:
        if hasattr(item.choices[0].delta, "content"):
            if item.choices[0].delta.content is None:
                # presence of 'None' indicates the end of the response
                break
            answer += item.choices[0].delta.content
            self.chat_history[-1] = (self.chat_history[-1][0], answer)
            yield
```

Finally, we have our chatbot!

### Next Steps

Congratulations! You have built your first chatbot. From here, you can read through the rest of the documentations to learn about Reflex in more detail. The best way to learn is to build something, so try to build your own app using this as a starting point!

### One More Thing

With our hosting service, you can deploy this app with a single command within minutes. Check out our [Hosting Quick Start]({hosting.deploy_quick_start.path}).


# Project Structure

```python exec
from pcweb.pages.docs import advanced_onboarding
```

## Directory Structure

```python exec
app_name = "hello"
```

Let's create a new app called `{app_name}`

```bash
mkdir {app_name}
cd {app_name}
reflex init
```

This will create a directory structure like this:

```bash
{app_name}
├── .web
├── assets
├── {app_name}
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── {app_name}.py
└── rxconfig.py
```

Let's go over each of these directories and files.

## .web

This is where the compiled Javascript files will be stored. You will never need to touch this directory, but it can be useful for debugging.

Each Reflex page will compile to a corresponding `.js` file in the `.web/pages` directory.

## Assets

The `assets` directory is where you can store any static assets you want to be publicly available. This includes images, fonts, and other files.

For example, if you save an image to `assets/image.png` you can display it from your app like this:

```python
rx.image(src="/image.png")
```
j
## Main Project

Initializing your project creates a directory with the same name as your app. This is where you will write your app's logic.

Reflex generates a default app within the `{app_name}/{app_name}.py` file. You can modify this file to customize your app.

## Configuration

The `rxconfig.py` file can be used to configure your app. By default it looks something like this:

```python
import reflex as rx


config = rx.Config(
    app_name="{app_name}",
)
```

We will discuss project structure and configuration in more detail in the [advanced project structure]({advanced_onboarding.code_structure.path}) documentation.

```python exec
from pcweb import constants
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.gallery import gallery
app_name = "my_app_name"
default_url = "http://localhost:3000"
```

# Installation

Reflex requires Python 3.10+.


```md video https://youtube.com/embed/ITOZkzjtjUA?start=758&end=1206
# Video: Installation
```


## Virtual Environment

We **highly recommend** creating a virtual environment for your project.

[venv]({constants.VENV_URL}) is the standard option. [conda]({constants.CONDA_URL}) and [poetry]({constants.POETRY_URL}) are some alternatives.

# Install Reflex on your system

---md tabs

--tab macOS/Linux
## Install on macOS/Linux

We will go with [venv]({constants.VENV_URL}) here.


### Prerequisites
macOS (Apple Silicon) users should install [Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861). Run this command:
    
`/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license`


### Create the project directory 

Replace `{app_name}` with your project name. Switch to the new directory.

```bash
mkdir {app_name}
cd {app_name}
```

### Setup virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```


```md alert info
# Getting `No module named venv`?

While Python typically ships with `venv` it is not installed by default on some systems.
If so, please install it manually. E.g. on Ubuntu Linux, run `sudo apt-get install python3-venv`.
```

### Install Reflex package

Reflex is available as a [pip]({constants.PIP_URL}) package.

```bash
pip install reflex
```

```md alert info
# Getting `command not found: pip`?

While Python typically ships with `pip` as the standard package management tool, it is not installed by default on some systems.
You may need to install it manually. E.g. on Ubuntu Linux, run `apt-get install python3-pip`
```

## Initialize the project

```bash
reflex init
```

```md alert warning
# Error `command not found: reflex` Mac / Linux
If you install Reflex with no virtual environment and get this error it means your `PATH` cannot find the reflex package. 
A virtual environment should solve this problem, or you can try running `python3 -m` before the reflex command.
```

--tab Windows
## Install on Windows

### Prerequisites
For Windows users, we recommend using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) for optimal performance.

WSL users should refer to instructions for Linux above.

For the rest of this section we will work with native Windows (non-WSL).

We will go with [venv]({constants.VENV_URL}) here, for virtual environments.

### Create the project directory 

Replace `{app_name}` with your project name. Switch to the new directory.

```bash
mkdir {app_name}
cd {app_name}
```

### Setup virtual environment

```bash
py -3 -m venv .venv
.venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

### Install Reflex package

Reflex is available as a [pip](constants.PIP_URL) package.

```bash
pip install reflex
```

## Initialize the project

```bash
reflex init
```

```md alert warning
# Error `command not found: reflex` Windows

The Reflex framework includes the `reflex` command line (CLI) tool. Using a virtual environment is highly recommended for a seamless experience.",
```

```md alert warning
# Error `Install Failed - You are missing a DLL required to run bun.exe` Windows
Bun requires runtime components of Visual C++ libraries to run on windows. This issue is fixed by installing [Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53840).

# Reflex Basics

This page gives an introduction to the most common concepts that you will use to build Reflex apps.

```md section
# You will learn how to:

- Create and nest components
- Customize and style components
- Distinguish between compile-time and runtime
- Display data that changes over time
- Respond to events and update the screen
- Render conditions and lists
- Create pages and navigate between them
```

[Install]({docs.getting_started.installation.path}) `reflex` using pip.

```bash
pip install reflex
```

Import the `reflex` library to get started.

```python
import reflex as rx
```

## Creating and nesting components

[Components]({docs.ui.overview.path}) are the building blocks for your app's user interface (UI). They are the visual elements that make up your app, like buttons, text, and images. Reflex has a wide selection of [built-in components]({library.path}) to get you started quickly.

Components are created using functions that return a component object.

```python demo exec
def my_button():
    return rx.button("Click Me")
```

Components can be nested inside each other to create complex UIs.

To nest components as children, pass them as positional arguments to the parent component. In the example below, the `rx.text` and `my_button` components are children of the `rx.box` component.

```python demo exec
def my_page():
    return rx.box(
        rx.text("This is a page"),
        # Reference components defined in other functions.
        my_button()
    )
```

You can also use any base HTML element through the [`rx.el`]({docs.library.other.html.path}) namespace. This allows you to use standard HTML elements directly in your Reflex app when you need more control or when a specific component isn't available in the Reflex component library.

```python demo exec
def my_div():
    return rx.el.div(
        rx.el.p("Use base html!"),
    )
```

If you need a component not provided by Reflex, you can check the [3rd party ecosystem]({custom_components.path}) or [wrap your own React component]({docs.wrapping_react.library_and_tags.path}).

## Customizing and styling components

Components can be customized using [props]({docs.components.props.path}), which are passed in as keyword arguments to the component function.

Each component has props that are specific to that component. Check the docs for the component you are using to see what props are available.

```python demo exec
def half_filled_progress():
    return rx.progress(value=50)
```

In addition to component-specific props, components can also be styled using CSS properties passed as props.

```python demo exec
def round_button():
    return rx.button("Click Me", border_radius="15px", font_size="18px")
```

```md alert
Use the `snake_case` version of the CSS property name as the prop name.
```

See the [styling guide]({docs.styling.overview.path}) for more information on how to style components

In summary, components are made up of children and props.

```md definition
# Children

- Text or other Reflex components nested inside a component.
- Passed as **positional arguments**.

# Props

- Attributes that affect the behavior and appearance of a component.
- Passed as **keyword arguments**.
```

## Displaying data that changes over time

Apps need to store and display data that changes over time. Reflex handles this through [State]({docs.state.overview.path}), which is a Python class that stores variables that can change when the app is running, as well as the functions that can change those variables.

To define a state class, subclass `rx.State` and define fields that store the state of your app. The state variables ([vars]({docs.vars.base_vars.path})) should have a type annotation, and can be initialized with a default value.

```python
class MyState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0
```

### Referencing state vars in components

To reference a state var in a component, you can pass it as a child or prop. The component will automatically update when the state changes.

Vars are referenced through class attributes on your state class. For example, to reference the `count` var in a component, use `MyState.count`.

```python demo exec
class MyState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0
    color: str = "red"

def counter():
    return rx.hstack(
        # The heading `color` prop is set to the `color` var in MyState.
        rx.heading("Count: ", color=MyState.color),
        # The `count` var in `MyState` is passed as a child to the heading component.
        rx.heading(MyState.count),
    )
```

Vars can be referenced in multiple components, and will automatically update when the state changes.

## Responding to events and updating the screen

So far, we've defined state vars but we haven't shown how to change them. All state changes are handled through functions in the state class, called [event handlers]({docs.events.events_overview.path}).

```md alert
Event handlers are the ONLY way to change state in Reflex.
```

Components have special props, such as `on_click`, called event triggers that can be used to make components interactive. Event triggers connect components to event handlers, which update the state.

```python demo exec
class CounterState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0

    @rx.event
    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1

def counter_increment():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.heading(CounterState.count),
        rx.button("Increment", on_click=CounterState.increment)
    )
```

When an event trigger is activated, the event handler is called, which updates the state. The UI is automatically re-rendered to reflect the new state. 


```md alert info
# What is the `@rx.event` decorator?
Adding the `@rx.event` decorator above the event handler is strongly recommended. This decorator enables proper static type checking, which ensures event handlers receive the correct number and types of arguments. This was introduced in Reflex version 0.6.5.
```

### Event handlers with arguments

Event handlers can also take in arguments. For example, the `increment` event handler can take an argument to increment the count by a specific amount.

```python demo exec
class CounterState2(rx.State):
    count: int = 0

    @rx.event
    def increment(self, amount: int):
        self.count += amount

def counter_variable():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.heading(CounterState2.count),
        rx.button("Increment by 1", on_click=lambda: CounterState2.increment(1)),
        rx.button("Increment by 5", on_click=lambda: CounterState2.increment(5)),
    )
```

The `on_click` event trigger doesn't pass any arguments here, but some event triggers do. For example, the `on_blur` event trigger passes the text of an input as an argument to the event handler.

```python demo exec
class TextState(rx.State):
    text: str = ""

    @rx.event
    def update_text(self, new_text: str):
        self.text = new_text

def text_input():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(TextState.text),
        rx.input(default_value=TextState.text, on_blur=TextState.update_text),
    )
```

```md alert
Make sure that the event handler has the same number of arguments as the event trigger, or an error will be raised.
```

## Compile-time vs. runtime (IMPORTANT)

Before we dive deeper into state, it's important to understand the difference between compile-time and runtime in Reflex.

When you run your app, the frontend gets compiled to Javascript code that runs in the browser (compile-time). The backend stays in Python and runs on the server during the lifetime of the app (runtime).

### When can you not use pure Python?

We cannot compile arbitrary Python code, only the components that you define. What this means importantly is that you cannot use arbitrary Python operations and functions on state vars in components.

However, since any event handlers in your state are on the backend, you **can use any Python code or library** within your state.

### Examples that work

Within an event handler, use any Python code or library.

```python demo exec
def check_even(num: int):
    return num % 2 == 0

class MyState3(rx.State):
    count: int = 0
    text: str = "even"

    @rx.event
    def increment(self):
        # Use any Python code within state.
        # Even reference functions defined outside the state.
        if check_even(self.count):
            self.text = "even"
        else:
            self.text = "odd"
        self.count += 1

def count_and_check():
    return rx.box(
        rx.heading(MyState3.text),
        rx.button("Increment", on_click=MyState3.increment)
    )
```

Use any Python function within components, as long as it is defined at compile time (i.e. does not reference any state var)

```python demo exec
def show_numbers():
    return rx.vstack(
        *[
            rx.hstack(i, check_even(i))
            for i in range(10)
        ]
    )
```

### Examples that don't work

You cannot do an `if` statement on vars in components, since the value is not known at compile time.

```python
class BadState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0

def count_if_even():
    return rx.box(
        rx.heading("Count: "),
        # This will raise a compile error, as BadState.count is a var and not known at compile time.
        rx.text(BadState.count if BadState.count % 2 == 0 else "Odd"),
        # Using an if statement with a var as a prop will NOT work either.
        rx.text("hello", color="red" if BadState.count % 2 == 0 else "blue"),
    )
```

You cannot do a `for` loop over a list of vars.

```python
class BadState(rx.State):
    items: list[str] = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

def loop_over_list():
    return rx.box(
        # This will raise a compile error, as BadState.items is a list and not known at compile time.
        *[rx.text(item) for item in BadState.items]
    )
```

You cannot do arbitrary Python operations on state vars in components.

```python
class BadTextState(rx.State):
    text: str = "Hello world"

def format_text():
    return rx.box(
        # Python operations such as `len` will not work on state vars.
        rx.text(len(BadTextState.text)),
    )
```

In the next sections, we will show how to handle these cases.

## Conditional rendering

As mentioned above, you cannot use Python `if/else` statements with state vars in components. Instead, use the [`rx.cond`]({docs.components.conditional_rendering.path}) function to conditionally render components.

```python demo exec
class LoginState(rx.State):
    logged_in: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def toggle_login(self):
        self.logged_in = not self.logged_in

def show_login():
    return rx.box(
        rx.cond(
            LoginState.logged_in,
            rx.heading("Logged In"),
            rx.heading("Not Logged In"),
        ),
        rx.button("Toggle Login", on_click=LoginState.toggle_login)
    )
```

## Rendering lists

To iterate over a var that is a list, use the [`rx.foreach`]({docs.components.rendering_iterables.path}) function to render a list of components.

Pass the list var and a function that returns a component as arguments to `rx.foreach`.

```python demo exec
class ListState(rx.State):
    items: list[str] = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

def render_item(item: rx.Var[str]):
    """Render a single item."""
    # Note that item here is a Var, not a str!
    return rx.list.item(item)

def show_fruits():
    return rx.box(
        rx.foreach(ListState.items, render_item),
    )
```

The function that renders each item takes in a `Var`, since this will get compiled up front.

## Var Operations

You can't use arbitrary Python operations on state vars in components, but Reflex has [var operations]({docs.vars.var_operations.path}) that you can use to manipulate state vars.

For example, to check if a var is even, you can use the `%` and `==` var operations.

```python demo exec
class CountEvenState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0

    @rx.event
    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1

def count_if_even():
    return rx.box(
        rx.heading("Count: "),
        rx.cond(
            # Here we use the `%` and `==` var operations to check if the count is even.
            CountEvenState.count % 2 == 0,
            rx.text("Even"),
            rx.text("Odd"),
        ),
        rx.button("Increment", on_click=CountEvenState.increment),
    )
```

## App and Pages

Reflex apps are created by instantiating the `rx.App` class. Pages are linked to specific URL routes, and are created by defining a function that returns a component.

```python
def index():
    return rx.text('Root Page')

rx.app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index, route="/")
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic understanding of how Reflex works, the next step is to start coding your own apps. Try one of the following tutorials:

- [Dashboard Tutorial]({getting_started.dashboard_tutorial.path})
- [Chatapp Tutorial]({getting_started.chatapp_tutorial.path})


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages import docs
```

# Tutorial: Data Dashboard

During this tutorial you will build a small data dashboard, where you can input data and it will be rendered in table and a graph. This tutorial does not assume any existing Reflex knowledge, but we do recommend checking out the quick [Basics Guide]({docs.getting_started.basics.path}) first. 

The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any Reflex app, and fully understanding it will give you a deep understanding of Reflex.


This tutorial is divided into several sections:

- **Setup for the Tutorial**: A starting point to follow the tutorial
- **Overview**: The fundamentals of Reflex UI (components and props)
- **Showing Dynamic Data**: How to use State to render data that will change in your app.
- **Add Data to your App**: Using a Form to let a user add data to your app and introduce event handlers.
- **Plotting Data in a Graph**: How to use Reflex's graphing components.
- **Final Cleanup and Conclusion**: How to further customize your app and add some extra styling to it.

### What are you building?

In this tutorial, you are building an interactive data dashboard with Reflex.

You can see what the finished app and code will look like here:

        rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
        rx.recharts.y_axis(),
        data=State.users_for_graph,
        width="100%",
        height=250,
    )

def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.vstack(
        add_customer_button(),
        rx.table.root(
            rx.table.header(
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Gender"),
                ),
            ),
            rx.table.body(
                rx.foreach(
                    State.users, show_user
                ),
            ),
            variant="surface",
            size="3",
            width="100%",
        ),

        align="center",
        width="100%",

)
```

Don't worry if you don't understand the code above, in this tutorial we are going to walk you through the whole thing step by step.


## Setup for the tutorial

Check out the [installation docs]({docs.getting_started.installation.path}) to get Reflex set up on your machine. Follow these to create a folder called `dashboard_tutorial`, which you will `cd` into and `pip install reflex`.

We will choose template `0` when we run `reflex init` to get the blank template. Finally run `reflex run` to start the app and confirm everything is set up correctly.


## Overview

Now that you’re set up, let’s get an overview of Reflex!

### Inspecting the starter code

Within our `dashboard_tutorial` folder we just `cd`'d into, there is a `rxconfig.py` file that contains the configuration for our Reflex app. (Check out the [config docs]({docs.advanced_onboarding.configuration.path}) for more information)

There is also an `assets` folder where static files such as images and stylesheets can be placed to be referenced within your app. ([asset docs]({docs.assets.overview.path}) for more information)

Most importantly there is a folder also called `dashboard_tutorial` which contains all the code for your app. Inside of this folder there is a file named `dashboard_tutorial.py`. To begin this tutorial we will delete all the code in this file so that we can start from scratch and explain every step as we go.

The first thing we need to do is import `reflex`. Once we have done this we can create a component, which is a reusable piece of user interface code. Components are used to render, manage, and update the UI elements in your application. 

Let's look at the example below. Here we have a function called `index` that returns a `text` component (an in-built Reflex UI component) that displays the text "Hello World!".

Next we define our app using `app = rx.App()` and add the component we just defined (`index`) to a page using `app.add_page(index)`. The function name (in this example `index`) which defines the component, must be what we pass into the `add_page`. The definition of the app and adding a component to a page are required for every Reflex app.

```python
import reflex as rx


def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.text("Hello World!")

app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index)
```

This code will render a page with the text "Hello World!" when you run your app like below:

```python eval
rx.text("Hello World!", 
    border_width="2px",
    border_radius="10px",
    padding="1em"
)
```

```md alert info
For the rest of the tutorial the `app=rx.App()` and `app.add_page` will be implied and not shown in the code snippets.
```

### Creating a table

Let's create a new component that will render a table. We will use the `table` component to do this. The `table` component has a `root`, which takes in a `header` and a `body`, which in turn take in `row` components. The `row` component takes in `cell` components which are the actual data that will be displayed in the table.

```python eval
rx.table.root(
        rx.table.header(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Gender"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.table.body(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.cell("Danilo Sousa"),
                rx.table.cell("danilo@example.com"),
                rx.table.cell("Male"),
            ),
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.cell("Zahra Ambessa"),
                rx.table.cell("zahra@example.com"),
                rx.table.cell("Female"),
            ),
        ),
        border_width="2px",
        border_radius="10px",
        padding="1em",
    )
```

```python
def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.table.root(
        rx.table.header(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Gender"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.table.body(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.cell("Danilo Sousa"),
                rx.table.cell("danilo@example.com"),
                rx.table.cell("Male"),
            ),
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.cell("Zahra Ambessa"),
                rx.table.cell("zahra@example.com"),
                rx.table.cell("Female"),
            ),
        ),
    )
```

Components in Reflex have `props`, which can be used to customize the component and are passed in as keyword arguments to the component function. 

The `rx.table.root` component has for example the `variant` and `size` props, which customize the table as seen below.

```python eval
rx.table.root(
        rx.table.header(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Gender"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.table.body(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.cell("Danilo Sousa"),
                rx.table.cell("danilo@example.com"),
                rx.table.cell("Male"),
            ),
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.cell("Zahra Ambessa"),
                rx.table.cell("zahra@example.com"),
                rx.table.cell("Female"),
            ),
        ),
        variant="surface",
        size="3",
        border_width="2px",
        border_radius="10px",
        padding="1em",
    )
```

```python
def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.table.root(
        rx.table.header(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Gender"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.table.body(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.cell("Danilo Sousa"),
                rx.table.cell("danilo@example.com"),
                rx.table.cell("Male"),
            ),
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.cell("Zahra Ambessa"),
                rx.table.cell("zahra@example.com"),
                rx.table.cell("Female"),
            ),
        ),
        variant="surface",
        size="3",
    )
```

## Showing dynamic data (State)

Up until this point all the data we are showing in the app is static. This is not very useful for a data dashboard. We need to be able to show dynamic data that can be added to and updated.

This is where `State` comes in. `State` is a Python class that stores variables that can change when the app is running, as well as the functions that can change those variables.

To define a state class, subclass `rx.State` and define fields that store the state of your app. The state variables (vars) should have a type annotation, and can be initialized with a default value. Check out the [basics]({docs.getting_started.basics.path}) section for a simple example of how state works.


In the example below we define a `State` class called `State` that has a variable called `users` that is a list of lists of strings. Each list in the `users` list represents a user and contains their name, email and gender.

```python
class State(rx.State):
    users: list[list[str]] = [
        ["Danilo Sousa", "danilo@example.com", "Male"],
        ["Zahra Ambessa", "zahra@example.com", "Female"],
    ]
```

To iterate over a state var that is a list, we use the [`rx.foreach`]({docs.components.rendering_iterables.path}) function to render a list of components. The `rx.foreach` component takes an `iterable` (list, tuple or dict) and a `function` that renders each item in the `iterable`.

```md alert info
# Why can we not just splat this in a `for` loop
You might be wondering why a `foreach` is even needed to render this state variable and why we cannot just splat a `for` loop. Check out this [documentation]({docs.getting_started.basics.path}#compile-time-vs.-runtime-(important)) to learn why.
```

Here the render function is `show_user` which takes in a single user and returns a `table.row` component that displays the users name, email and gender.

```python exec
class State1(rx.State):
    users: list[list[str]] = [
        ["Danilo Sousa", "danilo@example.com", "Male"],
        ["Zahra Ambessa", "zahra@example.com", "Female"],
    ]

def show_user1(person: list):
    """Show a person in a table row."""
    return rx.table.row(
        rx.table.cell(person[0]),
        rx.table.cell(person[1]),
        rx.table.cell(person[2]),
    )
```

```python eval
rx.table.root(
        rx.table.header(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Gender"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.table.body(
            rx.foreach(
                State1.users, show_user1
            ),
        ),
        variant="surface",
        size="3",
        border_width="2px",
        border_radius="10px",
        padding="1em",
)
```


```python
class State(rx.State):
    users: list[list[str]] = [
        ["Danilo Sousa", "danilo@example.com", "Male"],
        ["Zahra Ambessa", "zahra@example.com", "Female"],
    ]

def show_user(person: list):
    """Show a person in a table row."""
    return rx.table.row(
        rx.table.cell(person[0]),
        rx.table.cell(person[1]),
        rx.table.cell(person[2]),
    )

def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.table.root(
        rx.table.header(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Gender"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.table.body(
            rx.foreach(
                State.users, show_user
            ),
        ),
        variant="surface",
        size="3",
)
```

As you can see the output above looks the same as before, except now the data is no longer static and can change with user input to the app.

### Using a proper class structure for our data

So far our data has been defined in a list of lists, where the data is accessed by index i.e. `user[0]`, `user[1]`. This is not very maintainable as our app gets bigger. 

A better way to structure our data in Reflex is to use a class to represent a user. This way we can access the data using attributes i.e. `user.name`, `user.email`.

In Reflex when we create these classes to showcase our data, the class must inherit from `rx.Base`.

`rx.Base` is also necessary if we want to have a state var that is an iterable with different types. For example if we wanted to have `age` as an `int` we would have to use `rx.base` as we could not do this with a state var defined as `list[list[str]]`. 

The `show_user` render function is also updated to access the data by named attributes, instead of indexing.

```python exec
class User(rx.Base):
    """The user model."""

    name: str
    email: str
    gender: str


class State2(rx.State):
    users: list[User] = [
        User(name="Danilo Sousa", email="danilo@example.com", gender="Male"),
        User(name="Zahra Ambessa", email="zahra@example.com", gender="Female"),
    ]

def show_user2(user: User):
    """Show a person in a table row."""
    return rx.table.row(
        rx.table.cell(user.name),
        rx.table.cell(user.email),
        rx.table.cell(user.gender),
    )
```

```python eval
rx.table.root(
        rx.table.header(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Gender"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.table.body(
            rx.foreach(
                State2.users, show_user2
            ),
        ),
        variant="surface",
        size="3",
        border_width="2px",
        border_radius="10px",
        padding="1em",
)
```


```python
class User(rx.Base):
    """The user model."""

    name: str
    email: str
    gender: str


class State(rx.State):
    users: list[User] = [
        User(name="Danilo Sousa", email="danilo@example.com", gender="Male"),
        User(name="Zahra Ambessa", email="zahra@example.com", gender="Female"),
    ]

def show_user(user: User):
    """Show a person in a table row."""
    return rx.table.row(
        rx.table.cell(user.name),
        rx.table.cell(user.email),
        rx.table.cell(user.gender),
    )

def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.table.root(
        rx.table.header(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Gender"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.table.body(
            rx.foreach(
                State.users, show_user
            ),
        ),
        variant="surface",
        size="3",
)
```


Next let's add a form to the app so we can add new users to the table.


## Using a Form to Add Data 

We build a form using `rx.form`, which takes several components such as `rx.input` and `rx.select`, which represent the form fields that allow you to add information to submit with the form. Check out the [form]({docs.library.forms.form.path}) docs for more information on form components.

The `rx.input` component takes in several props. The `placeholder` prop is the text that is displayed in the input field when it is empty. The `name` prop is the name of the input field, which gets passed through in the dictionary when the form is submitted. The `required` prop is a boolean that determines if the input field is required.

The `rx.select` component takes in a list of options that are displayed in the dropdown. The other props used here are identical to the `rx.input` component.

```python demo
rx.form(
    rx.input(
        placeholder="User Name", name="name", required=True
    ),
    rx.input(
        placeholder="user@reflex.dev",
        name="email",
    ),
    rx.select(
        ["Male", "Female"],
        placeholder="Male",
        name="gender",
    ),
)
```

This form is all very compact as you can see from the example, so we need to add some styling to make it look better. We can do this by adding a `vstack` component around the form fields. The `vstack` component stacks the form fields vertically. Check out the [layout]({docs.styling.layout.path}) docs for more information on how to layout your app.


```python demo
rx.form(
    rx.vstack(
        rx.input(
            placeholder="User Name", name="name", required=True
        ),
        rx.input(
            placeholder="user@reflex.dev",
            name="email",
        ),
        rx.select(
            ["Male", "Female"],
            placeholder="Male",
            name="gender",
        ),
    ),
)
```

Now you have probably realised that we have all the form fields, but we have no way to submit the form. We can add a submit button to the form by adding a `rx.button` component to the `vstack` component. The `rx.button` component takes in the text that is displayed on the button and the `type` prop which is the type of button. The `type` prop is set to `submit` so that the form is submitted when the button is clicked. 

In addition to this we need a way to update the `users` state variable when the form is submitted. All state changes are handled through functions in the state class, called [event handlers]({docs.events.events_overview.path}).

Components have special props called event triggers, such as `on_submit`, that can be used to make components interactive. Event triggers connect components to event handlers, which update the state. Different event triggers expect the event handler that you hook them up to, to take in different arguments (and some do not take in any arguments).

The `on_submit` event trigger of `rx.form` is hooked up to the `add_user` event handler that is defined in the `State` class. This event trigger expects to pass a `dict`, containing the form data, to the event handler that it is hooked up to. The `add_user` event handler takes in the form data as a dictionary and appends it to the `users` state variable. 


```python
class State(rx.State):
    
    ...

    def add_user(self, form_data: dict):
        self.users.append(User(**form_data))


def form():
    return rx.form(
        rx.vstack(
            rx.input(
                placeholder="User Name", name="name", required=True
            ),
            rx.input(
                placeholder="user@reflex.dev",
                name="email",
            ),
            rx.select(
                ["Male", "Female"],
                placeholder="Male",
                name="gender",
            ),
            rx.button("Submit", type="submit"),
        ),
        on_submit=State.add_user,
        reset_on_submit=True,
    )
```

Finally we must add the new `form()` component we have defined to the `index()` function so that the form is rendered on the page.

Below is the full code for the app so far. If you try this form out you will see that you can add new users to the table by filling out the form and clicking the submit button. The form data will also appear as a toast (a small window in the corner of the page) on the screen when submitted.


```python exec
class State3(rx.State):
    users: list[User] = [
        User(name="Danilo Sousa", email="danilo@example.com", gender="Male"),
        User(name="Zahra Ambessa", email="zahra@example.com", gender="Female"),
    ]

    def add_user(self, form_data: dict):
        self.users.append(User(**form_data))
        

        return rx.toast.info(
            f"User has been added: {form_data}.",
            position="bottom-right",
        )

def show_user(user: User):
    """Show a person in a table row."""
    return rx.table.row(
        rx.table.cell(user.name),
        rx.table.cell(user.email),
        rx.table.cell(user.gender),
    )

def form():
    return rx.form(
        rx.vstack(
            rx.input(
                placeholder="User Name", name="name", required=True
            ),
            rx.input(

### Putting the Form in an Overlay

In Reflex, we like to make the user interaction as intuitive as possible. Placing the form we just constructed in an overlay creates a focused interaction by dimming the background, and ensures a cleaner layout when you have multiple action points such as editing and deleting as well.

We will place the form inside of a `rx.dialog` component (also called a modal). The `rx.dialog.root` contains all the parts of a dialog, and the `rx.dialog.trigger` wraps the control that will open the dialog. In our case the trigger will be an `rx.button` that says "Add User" as shown below.

```python
rx.dialog.trigger(
    rx.button(
        rx.icon("plus", size=26),
        rx.text("Add User", size="4"),
    ),
)
```

After the trigger we have the `rx.dialog.content` which contains everything within our dialog, including a title, a description and our form. The first way to close the dialog is without submitting the form and the second way is to close the dialog by submitting the form as shown below. This requires two `rx.dialog.close` components within the dialog.

```python
rx.dialog.close(
    rx.button(
        "Cancel",
        variant="soft",
        color_scheme="gray",
    ),
),
rx.dialog.close(
    rx.button(
        "Submit", type="submit"
    ),
)
```

The total code for the dialog with the form in it is below.

```python demo
rx.dialog.root(
    rx.dialog.trigger(
        rx.button(
            rx.icon("plus", size=26),
            rx.text("Add User", size="4"),
        ),
    ),
    rx.dialog.content(
        rx.dialog.title(
            "Add New User",
        ),
        rx.dialog.description(
            "Fill the form with the user's info",
        ),
        rx.form(
            # flex is similar to vstack and used to layout the form fields
            rx.flex(
                rx.input(
                    placeholder="User Name", name="name", required=True
                ),
                rx.input(
                    placeholder="user@reflex.dev",
                    name="email",
                ),
                rx.select(
                    ["Male", "Female"],
                    placeholder="Male",
                    name="gender",
                ),
                rx.flex(
                    rx.dialog.close(
                        rx.button(
                            "Cancel",
                            variant="soft",
                            color_scheme="gray",
                        ),
                    ),
                    rx.dialog.close(
                        rx.button(
                            "Submit", type="submit"
                        ),
                    ),
                    spacing="3",
                    justify="end",
                ),
                direction="column",
                spacing="4",
            ),
            on_submit=State3.add_user,
            reset_on_submit=False,
        ),
        # max_width is used to limit the width of the dialog
        max_width="450px",
    ),
)
```

At this point we have an app that allows you to add users to a table by filling out a form. The form is placed in a dialog that can be opened by clicking the "Add User" button. We change the name of the component from `form` to `add_customer_button` and update this in our `index` component. The full app so far and code are below.


```python exec
def add_customer_button() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.dialog.root(
        rx.dialog.trigger(
            rx.button(

                rx.text("Add User", size="4"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.dialog.content(
            rx.dialog.title(
                "Add New User",
            ),
            rx.dialog.description(
                "Fill the form with the user's info",
            ),
            rx.form(
                rx.flex(
                    rx.input(
                        placeholder="User Name", name="name", required=True
                    ),

                    ),
                    rx.select(
                        ["Male", "Female"],
                        placeholder="Male",
                        name="gender",

                            ),
                        ),
                        rx.dialog.close(
                            rx.button(

                            ),
                        ),

## Plotting Data in a Graph

The last part of this tutorial is to plot the user data in a graph. We will use Reflex's built-in graphing library recharts to plot the number of users of each gender. 

### Transforming the data for the graph

The graphing components in Reflex expect to take in a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a data point on the graph and contains the x and y values. We will create a new event handler in the state called `transform_data` to transform the user data into the format that the graphing components expect. We must also create a new state variable called `users_for_graph` to store the transformed data, which will be used to render the graph.


```python
from collections import Counter

class State(rx.State):
    users: list[User] = []
    users_for_graph: list[dict] = []

    def add_user(self, form_data: dict):
        self.users.append(User(**form_data))
        self.transform_data()
    
    def transform_data(self):
        """Transform user gender group data into a format suitable for visualization in graphs."""
        # Count users of each gender group
        gender_counts = Counter(user.gender for user in self.users)
        
        # Transform into list of dict so it can be used in the graph
        self.users_for_graph = [
            {
                "name": gender_group,
                "value": count
            }
            for gender_group, count in gender_counts.items()
        ]
```

As we can see above the `transform_data` event handler uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the number of users of each gender. We then create a list of dictionaries from this which we set to the state var `users_for_graph`. 

Finally we can see that whenever we add a new user through submitting the form and running the `add_user` event handler, we call the `transform_data` event handler to update the `users_for_graph` state variable.

### Rendering the graph

We use the `rx.recharts.bar_chart` component to render the graph. We pass through the state variable for our graphing data as `data=State.users_for_graph`. We also pass in a `rx.recharts.bar` component which represents the bars on the graph. The `rx.recharts.bar` component takes in the `data_key` prop which is the key in the data dictionary that represents the y value of the bar. The `stroke` and `fill` props are used to set the color of the bars.

The `rx.recharts.bar_chart` component also takes in `rx.recharts.x_axis` and `rx.recharts.y_axis` components which represent the x and y axes of the graph. The `data_key` prop of the `rx.recharts.x_axis` component is set to the key in the data dictionary that represents the x value of the bar. Finally we add `width` and `height` props to set the size of the graph.

```python
def graph():
    return rx.recharts.bar_chart(
        rx.recharts.bar(
            data_key="value",
            stroke=rx.color("accent", 9),
            fill=rx.color("accent", 8),
        ),
        rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
        rx.recharts.y_axis(),
        data=State.users_for_graph,
        width="100%",
        height=250,
    )
```

Finally we add this `graph()` component to our `index()` component so that the graph is rendered on the page. The code for the full app with the graph included is below. If you try this out you will see that the graph updates whenever you add a new user to the table.

```python exec
from collections import Counter

class State4(rx.State):
    users: list[User] = [
        User(name="Danilo Sousa", email="danilo@example.com", gender="Male"),
        User(name="Zahra Ambessa", email="zahra@example.com", gender="Female"),
    ]
    users_for_graph: list[dict] = []

    def add_user(self, form_data: dict):
        self.users.append(User(**form_data))
        self.transform_data()

        return rx.toast.info(
            f"User {form_data['name']} has been added.",
            position="bottom-right",
        )

```

One thing you may have noticed about your app is that the graph does not appear initially when you run the app, and that you must add a user to the table for it to first appear. This occurs because the `transform_data` event handler is only called when a user is added to the table. In the next section we will explore a solution to this.


## Final Cleanup

### Revisiting app.add_page

At the beginning of this tutorial we mentioned that the `app.add_page` function is required for every Reflex app. This function is used to add a component to a page. 

The `app.add_page` currently looks like this `app.add_page(index)`. We could change the route that the page renders on by setting the `route` prop such as `route="/custom-route"`, this would change the route to `http://localhost:3000/custom-route` for this page.

We can also set a `title` to be shown in the browser tab and a `description` as shown in search results. 

To solve the problem we had above about our graph not loading when the page loads, we can use `on_load` inside of `app.add_page` to call the `transform_data` event handler when the page loads. This would look like `on_load=State.transform_data`. Below see what our `app.add_page` would look like with some of the changes above added.

```python eval
rx.vstack(
    add_customer_button(),
    rx.table.root(
        rx.table.header(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Gender"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.table.body(
            rx.foreach(
                State4.users, show_user
            ),
        ),
        variant="surface",
        size="3",
    ),
    graph(),
    on_mouse_enter=State4.transform_data,
    border_width="2px",
    border_radius="10px",
    padding="1em",
)
```

```python
app.add_page(
    index,
    title="Customer Data App",
    description="A simple app to manage customer data.",
    on_load=State.transform_data,
)
```

### Revisiting app=rx.App()

At the beginning of the tutorial we also mentioned that we defined our app using `app=rx.App()`. We can also pass in some props to the `rx.App` component to customize the app.

The most important one is `theme` which allows you to customize the look and feel of the app. The `theme` prop takes in an `rx.theme` component which has several props that can be set. 

The `radius` prop sets the global radius value for the app that is inherited by all components that have a `radius` prop. It can be overwritten locally for a specific component by manually setting the `radius` prop.

The `accent_color` prop sets the accent color of the app. Check out other options for the accent color [here]({docs.library.other.theme.path}).

To see other props that can be set at the app level check out this [documentation]({docs.styling.theming.path})

```python
app = rx.App(
    theme=rx.theme(
        radius="full", accent_color="grass"
    ),
)
```

Unfortunately in this tutorial here we cannot actually apply this to the live example on the page, but if you copy and paste the code below into a reflex app locally you can see it in action.



## Conclusion

Finally let's make some final styling updates to our app. We will add some hover styling to the table rows and center the table inside the `show_user` with `style=\{"_hover": \{"bg": rx.color("gray", 3)}}, align="center"`.

In addition, we will add some `width="100%"` and `align="center"` to the `index()` component to center the items on the page and ensure they stretch the full width of the page.

)

app.add_page(
    index,
    title="Customer Data App",
    description="A simple app to manage customer data.",
    on_load=State.transform_data,
)
```

And that is it for your first dashboard tutorial. In this tutorial we have created 

- a table to display user data
- a form to add new users to the table
- a dialog to showcase the form
- a graph to visualize the user data

In addition to the above we have we have 

- explored state to allow you to show dynamic data that changes over time
- explored events to allow you to make your app interactive and respond to user actions
- added styling to the app to make it look better

image_style = {
  "width": "400px",
  "border_radius": "12px",
  "border": f"1px solid {c_color('slate', 5)}",
}
```

In order to publish a Python package, you need to use a publishing utility. Any would work, but we recommend either [Twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/package/#publishing-your-package).

## PyPI

It is straightforward to create accounts and API tokens with PyPI. There is official help on the [PyPI website](https://pypi.org/help/). For a quick reference here, go to the top right corner of the PyPI website and look for the button to register and fill out personal information.

```python eval
rx.center(
  rx.image(src="/custom_components/pypi_register.png", style=image_style, margin_bottom="16px", loading="lazy"),
)
```

A user can use username and password to authenticate with PyPI when publishing.

```python eval
rx.center(
  rx.image(src="/custom_components/pypi_account_settings.png", style=image_style, margin_bottom="16px", loading="lazy"),
)
```

Scroll down to the API tokens section and click on the "Add API token" button. Fill out the form and click "Generate API token".

```python eval
rx.center(
  rx.image(src="/custom_components/pypi_api_tokens.png", style=image_style, width="700px", loading="lazy"),
)
```


# Custom Components Overview

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import custom_components
from pcweb.pages.docs.custom_components import custom_components as custom_components_gallery
```

Reflex users create many components of their own: ready to use high level components, or nicely wrapped React components. With **Custom Components**, the community can easily share these components now.

Release **0.4.3** introduces a series of `reflex component` commands that help developers wrap react components, test, and publish them as python packages. As shown in the image below, there are already a few custom components published on PyPI, such as `reflex-spline`, `reflex-webcam`.

Check out the custom components gallery [here]({custom_components_gallery.path}).

```python eval
rx.center(
  rx.image(src="/custom_components/pypi_reflex_custom_components.png", width="400px", border_radius="15px", border="1px solid"),
)
```

## Prerequisites for Publishing

In order to publish a Python package, an account is required with a python package index, for example, PyPI. The documentation to create accounts and generate API tokens can be found on their websites. For a quick reference, check out our [Prerequisites for Publishing]({custom_components.prerequisites_for_publishing.path}) page.

## Steps to Publishing

Follow these steps to publish the custom component as a python package:

1. `reflex component init`: creates a new custom component project from templates.
2. dev and test: developer implements and tests the custom component.
3. `reflex component build`: builds the package.
4. `twine upload` or `uv publish`: uploads the package to a python package index.

### Initialization

```bash
reflex component init
```

First create a new folder for your custom component project, for example `color_picker`. The package name will be `reflex-color-picker`. The prefix `reflex-` is intentionally added for all custom components for easy search on PyPI. If you prefer a particular name for the package, you can either change it manually in the `pyproject.toml` file or add the `--library-name` option in the `reflex component init` command initially.

Run `reflex component init`, and a set of files and folders will be created in the `color_picker` folder. The `pyproject.toml` file is the configuration file for the project. The `custom_components` folder is where the custom component implementation is. The `color_picker_demo` folder is a demo Reflex app that uses the custom component. If this is the first time of creating python packages, it is encouraged to browse through all the files (there are not that many) to understand the structure of the project.

```bash
color_picker/
├── pyproject.toml            <- Configuration file
├── README.md
├── .gitignore                <- Exclude dist/ and metadata folders
├── custom_components/
│   └── reflex_color_picker/  <- Custom component source directory
│       ├── color_picker.py
│       └── __init__.py
└── color_picker_demo/        <- Demo Reflex app directory
    └── assets/
        color_picker_demo/
        requirements.txt
        rxconfig.py
```

### Develop and Test

After finishing the custom component implementation, the user is encouraged to fully test it before publishing. The generated Reflex demo app `color_picker_demo` is a good place to start. It is a regular Reflex app prefilled with imports and usage of this component. During the init, the `custom_component` folder is installed locally in editable mode, so a developer can incrementally develop and test with ease. The changes in component implementation are automatically reflected in the demo app.

### Publish

```bash
reflex component build
```

Once you're ready to publish your package, run `reflex component build` to build the package. The command builds the distribution files if they are not already built. The end result is a `dist` folder containing the distribution files. The user does not need to do anything manually with these distribution files.

In order to publish these files as a Python package, you need to use a publishing utility. Any would work, but we recommend either [Twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or (uv)[https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/package/#publishing-your-package]. Make sure to keep your package version in pyproject.toml updated.

You can also share your components with the rest of the community at our website using the command `reflex component share`. See you there!


```python exec
from pcweb.pages import docs
```

# Command Reference

The custom component commands are under `reflex component` subcommand. To see the list of available commands, run `reflex component --help`. To see the manual on a specific command, run `reflex component <command> --help`, for example, `reflex component init --help`.

```bash
reflex component --help
```

```text
Usage: reflex component [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Subcommands for creating and publishing Custom Components.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  init     Initialize a custom component.
  build    Build a custom component.
  share    Collect more details on the published package for gallery.

## reflex component init

Below is an example of running the `init` command.

```bash
reflex component init
```

```text
reflex component init
─────────────────────────────────────── Initializing reflex-google-auth project ───────────────────────────────────────

─────────────────────────────────────────────────── Project Summary ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
[ README.md ]: Package description. Please add usage examples.
[ pyproject.toml ]: Project configuration file. Please fill in details such as your name, email, homepage URL.
[ custom_components/ ]: Custom component code template. Start by editing it with your component implementation.
[ google_auth_demo/ ]: Demo App. Add more code to this app and test.
```

The `init` command uses the current enclosing folder name to construct a python package name, typically in the kebab case. For example, if running init in folder `google_auth`, the package name will be `reflex-google-auth`. The added prefix reduces the chance of name collision on PyPI (the Python Package Index), and it indicates that the package is a Reflex custom component. The user can override the package name by providing the `--package-name` option.

The `init` command creates a set of files and folders prefilled with the package name and other details. During the init, the `custom_component` folder is installed locally in editable mode, so a developer can incrementally develop and test with ease. The changes in component implementation is automatically reflected where it is used. Below is the folder structure after the `init` command.

```text
google_auth/
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── custom_components/
│   └── reflex_google_auth/
│       ├── google_auth.py
│       └── __init__.py
└── google_auth_demo/
    └── assets/
        google_auth_demo/
        requirements.txt
        rxconfig.py
```

### pyproject.toml

The `pyproject.toml` is required for the package to build and be published. It is prefilled with information such as the package name, version (`0.0.1`), author name and email, homepage URL. By default the **Apache-2.0** license is used, the same as Reflex. If any of this information requires update, the user can edit the file by hand.

### README

The `README.md` file is created with installation instructions, e.g. `pip install reflex-google-auth`, and a brief description of the package. Typically the `README.md` contains usage examples. On PyPI, the `README.md` is rendered as part of the package page.

### Custom Components Folder

The `custom_components` folder is where the actual implementation is. Do not worry about this folder name: there is no need to change it. It is where `pyproject.toml` specifies the source of the python package is. The published package contains the contents inside it, excluding this folder.

`reflex_google_auth` is the top folder for importable code. The `reflex_google_auth/__init__.py` imports everything from the `reflex_google_auth/google_auth.py`. For the user of the package, the import looks like `from reflex_google_auth import ABC, XYZ`.

`reflex_google_auth/google_auth.py` is prefilled with code example and instructions from the [wrapping react guide]({docs.wrapping_react.overview.path}).

### Demo App Folder

A demo app is generated inside `google_auth_demo` folder with import statements and example usage of the component. This is a regular Reflex app. Go into this directory and start using any reflex commands for testing.

### Help Manual

The help manual is shown when adding the `--help` option to the command.

```bash
reflex component init --help
```

```text
Usage: reflex component init [OPTIONS]

  Initialize a custom component.

  Args:     library_name: The name of the library.     install: Whether to
  install package from this local custom component in editable mode.
  loglevel: The log level to use.

  Raises:     Exit: If the pyproject.toml already exists.

Options:
  --library-name TEXT             The name of your library. On PyPI, package
                                  will be published as `reflex-{library-
                                  name}`.
  --install / --no-install        Whether to install package from this local
                                  custom component in editable mode.

  --loglevel [debug|info|warning|error|critical]
                                  The log level to use.  [default:
                                  LogLevel.INFO]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

## reflex component publish

To publish to a package index, a user is required to already have an account with them. As of **0.7.5**, Reflex does not handle the publishing process for you. You can do so manually by first running `reflex component build` followed by `twine upload` or `uv publish` or your choice of a publishing utility.

You can then share your build on our website with `reflex component share`.

## reflex component build

It is not required to run the `build` command separately before publishing. The `publish` command will build the package if it is not already built. The `build` command is provided for the user's convenience.

The `build` command generates the `.tar.gz` and `.whl` distribution files to be uploaded to the desired package index, for example, PyPI. This command must be run at the top level of the project where the `pyproject.toml` file is. As a result of a successful build, there is a new `dist` folder with the distribution files.

```bash
reflex component build --help
```

```text
Usage: reflex component build [OPTIONS]

  Build a custom component. Must be run from the project root directory where
  the pyproject.toml is.

  Args:     loglevel: The log level to use.

  Raises:     Exit: If the build fails.

Options:
  --loglevel [debug|info|warning|error|critical]
                                  The log level to use.  [default:
                                  LogLevel.INFO]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```


```python exec
from pcweb.pages.docs import vars
```

# Authentication Overview

Many apps require authentication to manage users. There are a few different ways to accomplish this in Reflex:

We have solutions that currently exist outside of the core framework:

1. Local Auth: Uses your own database: https://github.com/masenf/reflex-local-auth
2. Google Auth: Uses sign in with Google: https://github.com/masenf/reflex-google-auth
3. Captcha: Generates tests that humans can pass but automated systems cannot: https://github.com/masenf/reflex-google-recaptcha-v2
4. Magic Link Auth: A passwordless login method that sends a unique, one-time-use URL to a user's email: https://github.com/masenf/reflex-magic-link-auth
5. Clerk Auth: A community member wrapped this component and hooked it up in this app: https://github.com/TimChild/reflex-clerk-api
6. Descope Auth: Enables authentication with Descope, supporting passwordless, social login, SSO, and MFA: https://github.com/descope-sample-apps/reflex-descope-auth

If you're using the AI Builder, you can also use the built-in [Authentication Integrations](/docs/ai-builder/integrations/overview) which include Azure Auth, Google Auth, Okta Auth, and Descope.

## Guidance for Implementing Authentication

- Store sensitive user tokens and information in [backend-only vars]({vars.base_vars.path}#backend-only-vars).
- Validate user session and permissions for each event handler that performs an authenticated action and all computed vars or loader events that access private data.
- All content that is statically rendered in the frontend (for example, data hardcoded or loaded at compile time in the UI) will be publicly available, even if the page redirects to a login or uses `rx.cond` to hide content.
- Only data that originates from state can be truly private and protected.
- When using cookies or local storage, a signed JWT can detect and invalidate any local tampering.

# Deploy Reflex to Databricks

This guide walks you through deploying a Reflex web application on Databricks using the Apps platform.

## Prerequisites

- Databricks workspace with Unity Catalog enabled
- GitHub repository containing your Reflex application
- Reflex Enterprise license (for single-port deployment)

## Step 1: Connect Your Repository

1. **Link GitHub Repository**
   - Navigate to your Databricks workspace
   - Go to your user directory
   - Click **Create** → **Git folder**
   - Paste the URL of your GitHub repository containing the Reflex application

## Step 2: Configure Application Settings

### Create Configuration File

Create a new file called `app.yaml` directly in Databricks (not in GitHub):

```yaml
command: [
  "reflex", 
  "run",
  "--env",
  "prod",
  "--backend-port",
  "$DATABRICKS_APP_PORT"
]

env:
  - name: "HOME"
    value: "/tmp/reflex"
  - name: "REFLEX_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    value: "your-token-here"
  - name: "DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID"
    value: "your-sql-warehouse-id"
  - name: "DATABRICKS_CATALOG"
    value: "your-catalog-name"
  - name: "DATABRICKS_SCHEMA"
    value: "your-schema-name"
  - name: "REFLEX_SHOW_BUILT_WITH_REFLEX"
    value: 0
```

### Obtain Required Tokens

1. **Reflex Access Token**
   - Visit [Reflex Cloud Tokens](https://cloud.reflex.dev/tokens/)
   - Navigate to Account Settings → Tokens
   - Create a new token and copy the value
   - Replace `your-token-here` in the configuration
2. **Databricks Resources**
   - Update `DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID` with your SQL warehouse ID
   - Update `DATABRICKS_CATALOG` with your target catalog name
   - Update `DATABRICKS_SCHEMA` with your target schema name

## Step 3: Enable Single-Port Deployment

Update your Reflex application for Databricks compatibility:

### Update rxconfig.py

```python
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

rxe.Config(app_name="app", use_single_port=True)
```

### Update Application Entry Point

Modify your main application file where you define `rx.App`:

```python
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

app = rxe.App(
    # your app configuration
)
```

```md alert info
# Also add  `reflex-enterprise` and `asgiproxy`  to your `requirements.txt` file.
```

## Step 4: Create Databricks App

1. **Navigate to Apps**
   - Go to **Compute** → **Apps**
   - Click **Create App**
2. **Configure Application**
   - Select **Custom App**
   - Configure SQL warehouse for your application

## Step 5: Set Permissions

If you are using the `samples` Catalog then you can skip the permissions section.

### Catalog Permissions

1. Navigate to **Catalog** → Select your target catalog
2. Go to **Permissions**
3. Add the app's service principal user
4. Grant the following permissions:
   - **USE CATALOG**
   - **USE SCHEMA**

### Schema Permissions

1. Navigate to the specific schema
2. Go to **Permissions**
3. Grant the following permissions:
   - **USE SCHEMA**
   - **EXECUTE**
   - **SELECT**
   - **READ VOLUME** (if required)

## Step 6: Deploy Application

1. **Initiate Deployment**
   - Click **Deploy** in the Apps interface
   - When prompted for the code path, provide your Git folder path or select your repository folder
2. **Monitor Deployment**
   - The deployment process will begin automatically
   - Monitor logs for any configuration issues

## Updating Your Application

To deploy updates from your GitHub repository:

1. **Pull Latest Changes**
   - In the deployment interface, click **Deployment Source**
   - Select **main** branch
   - Click **Pull** to fetch the latest changes from GitHub
2. **Redeploy**
   - Click **Deploy** again to apply the updates

            rx.table.cell("SQL warehouse identifier"),
            rx.table.cell("Auto-assigned"),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.cell(rx.code("DATABRICKS_CATALOG")),
            rx.table.cell("Target catalog name"),

            rx.table.cell("Show Reflex branding (Enterprise only)"),
            rx.table.cell([rx.code("0"), " or ", rx.code("1")]),
        ),
    ),
    variant="surface",
    margin_y="1em",
)
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Errors**: Verify that all catalog and schema permissions are correctly set
- **Port Issues**: Ensure you're using `$DATABRICKS_APP_PORT` and single-port configuration
- **Token Issues**: Verify your Reflex access token is valid and properly configured
- **Deployment Failures**: Check the deployment logs for specific error messages

## Notes

- Single-port deployment requires Reflex Enterprise
- Configuration must be created directly in Databricks, not pushed from GitHub
- Updates require manual pulling from the deployment interface


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
from pcweb.pages.docs import hosting 
from pcweb.pages import docs
from pcweb.styles.styles import get_code_style, cell_style
```

## Machine Types


To scale your app you can choose different VMTypes. VMTypes are different configurations of CPU and RAM.

To scale your VM in the Cloud UI, click on the `Settings` tab in the Cloud UI on the app page, and then click on the `Scale` tab as shown below. Clicking on the `Change VM` button will allow you to scale your app.

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/scaling_vms.webp", padding_bottom="20px"))
```

### VMTypes in the CLI

To get all the possible VMTypes you can run the following command:

```bash
reflex cloud vmtypes
```

To set which VMType to use when deploying your app you can pass the `--vmtype` flag with the id of the VMType. For example:

```bash
reflex deploy --project f88b1574-f101-####-####-5f########## --vmtype c2m4
```

This will deploy your app with the `c2m4` VMType, giving your app 2 CPU cores and 4 GB of RAM.

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
from pcweb.pages.pricing.calculator import compute_table_base
```

## Compute Usage

Reflex Cloud is billed on a per second basis so you only pay for when your app is being used by your end users. When your app is idle, you are not charged. 

This allows you to deploy your app on larger sizes and multiple regions without worrying about paying for idle compute. We bill on a per second basis so you only pay for the compute you use.

By default your app stays alive for 5 minutes after the no users are connected. After this time your app will be considered idle and you will not be charged. Start up times usually take less than 1 second for you apps to come back online.

#### Warm vs Cold Start
- Apps below `c2m2` are considered warm starts and are usually less than 1 second.
- If your app is larger than `c2m2` it will be a cold start which takes around 15 seconds. If you want to avoid this you can reserve a machine.

## Compute Pricing Table

```python eval
compute_table_base()
```

## Reserved Machines (Coming Soon)

If you expect your apps to be continuously receiving users, you may want to reserve a machine instead of having us manage your compute. 

This will be a flat monthly rate for the machine.

## Monitoring Usage

To monitor your projects usage, you can go to the billing tab in the Reflex Cloud UI on the project page.

Here you can see the current billing and usage for your project.

# Single Application - Single Region

Anna, a hobbyist game developer, built a pixel art generator and hosted it on Reflex Cloud so fellow artists could use it anytime. She deployed her app in the San Francisco region, where she lives. If her users use the site for an hour a day, how much would Anna pay?

**Facts:**

- **Machine size:** `c1m1` (1 CPU, 1 GB Memory) - `$0.083` per hour
- **Regions:** `1` (SJC)
- **Avg usage per day per region:** `1 Hour`

**Maths:**

`1 region * 1 hour * 30 days = 30 compute hours`

`30 * 0.083 = 2.49`

(assuming a 30 day month)

Anna's total cost for compute would be `$2.49` for the month. However, since paid users receive a `$10` credit, her compute cost is fully covered.

**Charge for compute:**

`$0.00 dollars`

# Single Application - Multi Region

Bob created a social media application and decided to host it on Reflex Cloud. Bob has users in Paris, London, San Jose and Sydney. Bob decided to deploy his application to all those region as well as additional one in Paris since that where Bob lives. If users use the site in each region for 30 minutes a day how much would Bob pay?

**Facts:**

- **Machine size:** `c1m1` (1 CPU, 1 GB Memory) - `$0.083` Cost per hour
- **Regions:** `5` (CDG x 2, LHR x 1, SJC x 1, SYD x 1)
- **Avg usage per day per region:** `0.5 Hours`

**Maths:**

`5 regions * 0.5 hours * 30 days = 75 compute hours` 

`75 * 0.083 = 6.23`

(assuming a 30 day month)

Bob would owe `$6.23` for this month. However since Bob is a paid user they receive a `$10` credit which brings Bob's bill down to `$0`.

# Single Growing Application - Multi Region

Charlie, a small startup founder, built a finance tracking app that allows users to create and share finance insights in real time. As his user base expanded across different regions, he needed a multi-region setup to reduce latency and improve performance. To ensure a smooth experience, he deployed his app on Reflex Cloud using a `c1m2` machine in four regions.

If users access the app on average for **16 hours per week** in each region, how much would Charlie pay?

**Facts:**
- **Machine size:** `c1m2` (1 CPU, 2 GB Memory) - `$0.157` per hour  
- **Regions:** `4`  
- **Avg usage per week per region:** `16 Hours`

**Maths:**

`4 regions * 16 hours * 4 weeks = 256 compute hours` 

`256 * 0.157 = 40.19`

(assuming 4 weeks in a month)

Charlie would owe `$40.19` for this month. However since Charlie is a paid user they receive a `$10` credit which brings Bob's bill down to `$30.19`.

With users actively using the app **6 hours per day in each region** over a **30-day month**, how much would Emily pay?


**Facts:**
- **Machine size:** `c1m1` (1 CPU, 1 GB Memory) - `$0.083` per hour  
- **Regions:** `3`  
- **Avg usage per day per region:** `6 Hours`


**Maths:**

`3 regions * 6 hours * 30 days = 540 compute hours` 

`540 * 0.083 = 44.82`

(assuming a 30 day month)

Emily would owe `$44.82` for this month. However since Emily is a paid user they receive a `$10` credit which brings Emily's bill down to `$34.82`.

# Multiple Apps - Multiple Regions 

Fred, a **freelance developer**, built a **portfolio of web applications** that cater to different clients across the globe. He has built **5 apps** where **4 apps** have a small amount of traffic with an average of **0.5 hours a day** and **1 app** that has a high amount of traffic with an average of **6 hours** a day. He has deployed the 4 small traffic apps on a `c1m1` machine in **1 region** each and the high traffic app on a `c1m1` machine in **2 regions**. How much would Fred pay?


**Facts for 4 small traffic apps:**
- **Machine size:** `c1m1` (1 CPU, 1 GB Memory) - `$0.083` per hour  
- **Regions:** `1`  
- **Avg usage per day per region:** `0.5 Hours`


**Facts for 1 large traffic app:**
- **Machine size:** `c1m1` (1 CPU, 1 GB Memory) - `$0.083` per hour  
- **Regions:** `2`  
- **Avg usage per day per region:** `6 Hours`


**Maths:**

4 small traffic apps:

`4 apps * 1 region * 0.5 hours * 30 days = 60 compute hours` 

1 large traffic apps:

`2 regions * 6 hours * 30 days = 360 compute hours` 

Total compute hours = `60 + 360 = 420 compute hours`

`420 * 0.083 = 34.86`

(assuming a 30 day month)

Fred would owe `$34.86` for this month. However since Fred is a paid user they receive a `$10` credit which brings Fred's bill down to `$24.86`.

**Charge for compute:**

`$24.82 dollars`
```

One thing that is important to note is that in the hypothetical example where you have `50 people` using your app `continuously for 24 hours` or if you have `1 person` using your app `continuously for 24 hours`, you `will be charged the same amount` as the charge is based on the amount of time your app up and not the number of users using your app. In `both these examples` your `app is up for 24 hours` and therefore you will be `charged for 24 hours of compute`.

# Reflex Cloud - Quick Start

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
from pcweb.pages import docs
```

So far, we have been running our apps locally on our own machines.
But what if we want to share our apps with the world? This is where
the hosting service comes in.

## Quick Start

Reflex’s hosting service makes it easy to deploy your apps without worrying about configuring the infrastructure.

### Prerequisites

1. Hosting service requires `reflex>=0.6.6`.
2. This tutorial assumes you have successfully `reflex init` and `reflex run` your app.
3. Also make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file at the top level app directory that contains all your python dependencies! (To create a `requirements.txt` file, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.)


### Authentication

First run the command below to login / signup to your Reflex Cloud account: (command line)

```bash
reflex login
```

You will be redirected to your browser where you can authenticate through Github or Gmail.

### Web UI

Once you are at this URL and you have successfully authenticated, click on the one project you have in your workspace. You should get a screen like this:

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/cloud_project_page.png", alt="Reflex Cloud Dashboard"))
```

This screen shows the login command and the deploy command. As we are already logged in, we can skip the login command.

### Deployment

Now you can start deploying your app.

In your cloud UI copy the `reflex deploy` command similar to the one shown below.

```bash
reflex deploy --project 2a432b8f-2605-4753-####-####0cd1####
```

In your project directory (where you would normally run `reflex run`) paste this command.

The command is by default interactive. It asks you a few questions for information required for the deployment.


1. The first question will compare your `requirements.txt` to your python environment and if they are different then it will ask you if you want to update your `requirements.txt` or to continue with the current one. If they are identical this question will not appear. To create a `requirements.txt` file, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
2. The second question will search for a deployed app with the name of your current app, if it does not find one then it will ask if you wish to proceed in deploying your new app.
3. The third question is optional and will ask you for an app description.


That’s it! You should receive some feedback on the progress of your deployment and in a few minutes your app should be up. 🎉

For detailed information about the deploy command and its options, see the [Deploy API Reference]({docs.cloud.deploy.path}) and the [CLI Reference](https://reflex.dev/docs/api-reference/cli/).


```md alert info
# Once your code is uploaded, the hosting service will start the deployment. After a complete upload, exiting from the command **does not** affect the deployment process. The command prints a message when you can safely close it without affecting the deployment.
```

If you go back to the Cloud UI you should be able to see your deployed app and other useful app information.


```md alert info
# Setup a Cloud Config File
To create a `config.yml` file for your app to set your app configuration check out the [Cloud Config Docs]({docs.hosting.config_file.path}).
```

```md alert info
# Moving around the Cloud UI
To go back, i.e. from an app to a project or from a project to your list of projects you just click the `REFLEX logo` in the top left corner of the page.
```

```md alert info
# All flag values are saved between runs
All your flag values, i.e. environment variables or regions or tokens, are saved between runs. This means that if you run a command and you pass a flag value, the next time you run the same command the flag value will be the same as the last time you ran it. This means you should only set the flag values again if you want to change them.
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
```

# Custom Domains


With the Enterprise tier of Reflex Cloud you can use your own custom domain to host your app. 

## Prerequisites

You must purchase a domain from a domain registrar such as GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Namecheap, or AWS. 

For this tutorial we will use GoDaddy and the example domain `tomgotsman.us`.


## Steps

Once you have purchased your domain, you can add it to your Reflex Cloud app by following these steps:

1 - Ensure you have deployed your app to Reflex Cloud.

2 - Once your app is deployed click the `Custom Domain` tab and add your custom domain to the input field and press the Add domain button. You should now see a page like below:

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/custom-domains-DNS-inputs.png"))
```

```python eval
rx.box(height="20px")
```

3 - On the domain registrar's website, navigate to the DNS settings for your domain. It should look something like the image below:

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/custom-domains-DNS-before.png"))
```

```python eval
rx.box(height="20px")
```

4 - Add all four of the DNS records provided by Reflex Cloud to your domain registrar's DNS settings. If there is already an A name record, delete it and replace it with the one provided by Reflex Cloud. Your DNS settings should look like the image below:

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/custom-domains-DNS-after.png"))
```

```md alert warning
# It may alert you that this record will resolve on ######.tomgotsman.us.tomgotsman.us.
If this happens ensure that you select to only have the record resolve on ######.tomgotsman.us.
```

```md alert warning
# Your domain provider may not support an Apex CNAME record, in this case just use an A record.
![Image showing failed CNAME record](/custom-domains-CNAME-fail.png)
```

```python eval
rx.box(height="20px")
```

5 - Once you have added the DNS records, refresh the page on the Reflex Cloud page (it may take a few minutes to a few hours to update successfully). If the records are correct, you should see a success message like the one below:

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/custom-domains-success.png"))
```

```python eval
rx.box(height="20px")
```

6 - Now redeploy your app using the `reflex deploy` command and your app should now be live on your custom domain!

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
from pcweb.pages.pricing.calculator import compute_table_base
from pcweb.pages.docs import hosting 
```

## Overview 

Billing for Reflex Cloud is monthly per project. Project owners and admins are able to view and manage the billing page. 

The billing for a project is comprised of two parts - number of `seats` and `compute`. 

## Seats

Projects on a paid plan can invite collaborators to join their project. 

Each additional collaborator is considered a `seat` and is charged on a flat monthly rate. Project owners and admins can manage permissions and roles for each seat in the settings tab on the project page. 

## Compute

Reflex Cloud is billed on a per second basis so you only pay for when your app is being used by your end users. When your app is idle, you are not charged. 

For more information on compute pricing, please see the [compute]({hosting.compute.path}) page.

## Manage Billing

To manage your billing, you can go to the `Billing` tab in the Cloud UI on the project page.

## Setting Billing Limits

If you want to set a billing limit for your project, you can do so by going to the `Billing` tab in the Cloud UI on the project page.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
```

# Project

A project is a collection of applications (apps / websites).

Every project has its own billing page that are accessible to Admins.



## Adding Team Members

To see the team members of a project click on the `Members` tab in the Cloud UI on the project page. 

If you are a User you have the ability to create, deploy and delete apps, but you do not have the power to add or delete users from that project. You must be an Admin for that.

As an Admin you will see the an `Add user` button in the top right of the screen, as shown in the image below. Clicking on this will allow you to add a user to the project. You will need to enter the email address of the user you wish to add.

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/hosting_adding_team_members.png", alt="Adding team members to Reflex Cloud"))
```

```python eval
rx.box(height="20px")
```

```md alert warning
# Currently a User must already have logged in once before they can be added to a project. 
At this time a User must be logged in to be added to a project. In future there will be automatic email invites sent to add new users who have never logged in before.
```


## Other project settings

Clicking on the `Settings` tab in the Cloud UI on the project page allows a user to change the `project name`, check the `project id` and, if the project is not your default project, delete the project.

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
from pcweb.pages.docs import hosting 
from pcweb.pages import docs
from pcweb.styles.styles import get_code_style, cell_style

## Regions

To scale your app you can choose different regions. Regions are different locations around the world where your app can be deployed. 

To scale your app to multiple regions in the Cloud UI, click on the `Settings` tab in the Cloud UI on the app page, and then click on the `Regions` tab as shown below. Clicking on the `Add new region` button will allow you to scale your app to multiple regions.

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/scaling_regions.webp", padding_bottom="20px"))
```

The table below show all the regions that can be deployed in.

```python eval

    ),
    class_name="w-full table-fixed rounded-xl overflow-hidden divide-y divide-slate-4",
)
```

### Selecting Regions to Deploy in the CLI

Below is an example of how to deploy your app in several regions:

```bash
reflex deploy --project f88b1574-f101-####-####-5f########## --region sjc --region iad
```

By default all apps are deloyed in `sjc` if no other regions are given. If you wish to deploy in another region or several regions you can pass the `--region` flag (`-r` also works) with the region code. Check out all the regions that we can deploy to below:


## Config File

To create a `config.yml` file for your app run the command below:

```bash
reflex cloud config
```

This will create a yaml file similar to the one below where you can edit the app configuration:

```yaml
name: medo
description: ''
regions:
  sjc: 1
  lhr: 2
vmtype: c1m1
hostname: null
envfile: .env
project: null
packages:
- procps
```



```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
from pcweb.pages.docs import hosting
from pcweb.pages import docs
from pcweb.styles.styles import get_code_style, cell_style
```

## What is reflex cloud config?

The following command:

```bash
reflex cloud config
```

generates a `cloud.yml` configuration file used to deploy your Reflex app to the Reflex cloud platform. This file tells Reflex how and where to run your app in the cloud.

## Configuration File Structure

The `cloud.yml` file uses YAML format and supports the following structure. **All fields are optional** and will use sensible defaults if not specified:

```yaml
# Basic deployment settings
name: my-app-prod                    # Optional: defaults to project folder name
description: 'Production deployment' # Optional: empty by default
projectname: my-client-project          # Optional: defaults to personal project

## Configuration Options

For details of specific sections click the links in the table.

### Projects

Organize deployments using projects:

```yaml
projectname: client-alpha    # Groups related deployments
```

You can also specify a project uuid instead of name:
```yaml
project: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab
```

You can go to the homepage of the project in the reflex cloud dashboard to find your project uuid in the url `https://cloud.reflex.dev/project/uuid`

### Apt Packages

Install additional system packages your application requires. Package names are based on the apt package manager:

```yaml
packages:
  - procps=2.0.32-1  # Version pinning is optional
  - imagemagick 
  - ffmpeg      
```

### Include SQLite

Include local sqlite database:

```yaml
include_db: true
```

This is not persistent and will be lost on restart. It is recommended to use a database service instead.

### Strategy

Deployment strategy:
Available strategies:
- `immediate`: [Default] Deploy immediately
- `rolling`: Deploy in a rolling manner
- `bluegreen`: Deploy in a blue-green manner
- `canary`: Deploy in a canary manner, boot as single machine verify its health and then restart the rest.

```yaml
strategy: immediate
```

## Multi-Environment Setup

**Development (`cloud-dev.yml`):**
```yaml
name: myapp-dev
description: 'Development environment'
vmtype: c1m1
envfile: .env.development
```

**Staging (`cloud-staging.yml`):**
```yaml
name: myapp-staging
description: 'Staging environment'
regions:
  sjc: 1
vmtype: c2m2
envfile: .env.staging
```

**Production (`cloud-prod.yml`):**
```yaml
name: myapp-production
description: 'Production environment'
regions:
  sjc: 2
  lhr: 1
vmtype: c4m4
hostname: myapp
envfile: .env.production
```

Deploy with specific configuration files:

```bash
# Use default cloud.yml
reflex deploy

# Use specific configuration file
reflex deploy --config cloud-prod.yml
reflex deploy --config cloud-staging.yml
```



```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom

```

# App

In Reflex Cloud an "app" (or "application" or "website") refers to a web application built using the Reflex framework, which can be deployed and managed within the Cloud platform. 

You can deploy an app using the `reflex deploy` command.

There are many actions you can take in the Cloud UI to manage your app. Below are some of the most common actions you may want to take.


## Stopping an App

To stop an app follow the arrow in the image below and press on the `Stop app` button. Pausing an app will stop it from running and will not be accessible to users until you resume it. In addition, this will stop you being billed for your app.

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/stopping_app.webp", padding_bottom="20px"))
```

```md alert info
# CLI Command to stop an app
`reflex cloud apps stop [OPTIONS] [APP_ID]`
```

## Deleting an App

To delete an app click on the `Settings` tab in the Cloud UI on the app page.

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/environment_variables.webp"))
```

Then click on the `Danger` tab as shown below.

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/deleting_app.webp"))
```

Here there is a `Delete app` button. Pressing this button will delete the app and all of its data. This action is irreversible.

```md alert info
# CLI Command to delete an app
`reflex cloud apps delete [OPTIONS] [APP_ID]`
```


## Other app settings

Clicking on the `Settings` tab in the Cloud UI on the app page also allows a user to change the `app name`, change the `app description` and check the `app id`.

The other app settings also allows users to edit and add secrets (environment variables) to the app. For more information on secrets, see the [Secrets (Environment Variables)]({hosting.secrets_environment_vars.path}) page.


```python exec
from pcweb.pages import docs
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.styles.styles import get_code_style, cell_style

github_actions_configs = [
    {
        "name": "auth_token",
        "description": "Reflex authentication token stored in GitHub Secrets.",
        "required": True,
        "default": "N/A"
    },
    {
        "name": "project_id",
        "description": "The ID of the project you want to deploy to.",
        "required": True,
        "default": "N/A"
    },
    {
        "name": "app_directory",
        "description": "The directory containing your Reflex app.",
        "required": False,
        "default": ". (root)"
    },
    {
        "name": "extra_args",
        "description": "Additional arguments to pass to the `reflex deploy` command.",
        "required": False,
        "default": "N/A"
    },
    {
        "name": "python_version",
        "description": "The Python version to use for the deployment environment.",
        "required": False,
        "default": "3.12"
    }
]
```

# Deploy with Github Actions

This GitHub Action simplifies the deployment of Reflex applications to Reflex Cloud. It handles setting up the environment, installing the Reflex CLI, and deploying your app with minimal configuration.

```md alert info
# This action requires `reflex>=0.6.6`
```

**Features:**
- Deploy Reflex apps directly from your GitHub repository to Reflex Cloud.
- Supports subdirectory-based app structures.
- Securely uses authentication tokens via GitHub Secrets.

## Usage
### Add the Action to Your Workflow
Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your repository and add the following:

```yaml
name: Deploy Reflex App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Reflex Cloud
        uses: reflex-dev/reflex-deploy-action@v1
        with:
          auth_token: ${\{ secrets.REFLEX_PROJECT_ID }}
          project_id: ${\{ secrets.REFLEX_PROJECT_ID }}
          app_directory: "my-app-folder" # Optional, defaults to root
          extra_args: "--env THIRD_PARTY_APIKEY=***" # Optional
          python_version: "3.12" # Optional
```

### Set Up Your Secrets
Store your Reflex authentication token securely in your repository's secrets:


1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret.
3. Create new secrets for `REFLEX_AUTH_TOKEN` and `REFLEX_PROJECT_ID`. 

(Create a `REFLEX_AUTH_TOKEN` in the tokens tab of your UI, check out these [docs]({docs.hosting.tokens.path}#tokens). 

The `REFLEX_PROJECT_ID` can be found in the UI when you click on the How to deploy button on the top right when inside a project and copy the ID after the `--project` flag.)

```

# Secrets (Environment Variables)


## Adding Secrets through the CLI

Below is an example of how to use an environment variable file. You can pass the `--envfile` flag with the path to the env file. For example:

```bash
reflex deploy --project f88b1574-f101-####-####-5f########## --envfile .env
```

In this example the path to the file is `.env`.


If you prefer to pass the environment variables manually below is deployment command example:

```bash
reflex deploy --project f88b1574-f101-####-####-5f########## --env OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-vD4i9t6U############################
```

They are passed after the `--env` flag as key value pairs. 

To pass multiple environment variables, you can repeat the `--env` tag. i.e. `reflex deploy --project f88b1574-f101-####-####-5f########## --env KEY1=VALUE1 --env KEY2=VALUE`. The `--envfile` flag will override any envs set manually.


```md alert info
# More information on Environment Variables
Environment variables are encrypted and safely stored. We recommend that backend API keys or secrets are entered as `envs`. Make sure to enter the `envs` without any quotation marks. We do not show the values of them in any CLI commands, only their names (or keys).

You access the values of `envs` by referencing `os.environ` with their names as keys in your app's backend. For example, if you set an env `ASYNC_DB_URL`, you are able to access it by `os.environ["ASYNC_DB_URL"]`. Some Python libraries automatically look for certain environment variables. For example, `OPENAI_API_KEY` for the `openai` python client. The `boto3` client credentials can be configured by setting `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. This information is typically available in the documentation of the Python packages you use.
```

## Adding Secrets through the Cloud UI

To find the secrets tab, click on the `Settings` tab in the Cloud UI on the app page.

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/environment_variables.webp"))
```

Then click on the `Secrets` tab as shown below.

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/environment_variables_2.webp"))
```

From here you can add or edit your environment variables. You will need to restart your app for these changes to take effect.

This functionality in the UI can be disabled by an admin of the project.

```python exec
import reflex as rx

from pcweb.pages.docs import getting_started
from pcweb.pages.pricing.pricing import pricing_path
```

# Self Hosting

We recommend using `reflex deploy`, but if this does not fit your use case then you can also host your apps yourself.

Clone your code to a server and install the [requirements]({getting_started.installation.path}).

## API URL

Edit your `rxconfig.py` file and set `api_url` to the publicly accessible IP
address or hostname of your server, with the port `:8000` at the end. Setting
this correctly is essential for the frontend to interact with the backend state.

For example if your server is at `app.example.com`, your config would look like this:

```python
config = rx.Config(
    app_name="your_app_name",
    api_url="http://app.example.com:8000",
)
```

It is also possible to set the environment variable `API_URL` at run time or
export time to retain the default for local development.

## Production Mode

Then run your app in production mode:

```bash
reflex run --env prod
```

Production mode creates an optimized build of your app.  By default, the static
frontend of the app (HTML, Javascript, CSS) will be exposed on port `3000` and
the backend (event handlers) will be listening on port `8000`.

```md alert warning
# Reverse Proxy and Websockets
Because the backend uses websockets, some reverse proxy servers, like [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/websocket.html) or [apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html#protoupgrade), must be configured to pass the `Upgrade` header to allow backend connectivity.
```

## Exporting a Static Build

Exporting a static build of the frontend allows the app to be served using a
static hosting provider, like Netlify or Github Pages. Be sure `api_url` is set
to an accessible backend URL when the frontend is exported.

```bash
API_URL=http://app.example.com:8000 reflex export
```

This will create a `frontend.zip` file with your app's minified HTML,
Javascript, and CSS build that can be uploaded to your static hosting service.

It also creates a `backend.zip` file with your app's backend python code to
upload to your server and run.

You can export only the frontend or backend by passing in the `--frontend-only`
or `--backend-only` flags.

It is also possible to export the components without zipping. To do
this, use the `--no-zip` parameter. This provides the frontend in the
`.web/build/client/` directory and the backend can be found in the root directory of
the project.

## Reflex Container Service

Another option is to run your Reflex service in a container. For this
purpose, a `Dockerfile` and additional documentation is available in the Reflex
project in the directory `docker-example`.

For the build of the container image it is necessary to edit the `rxconfig.py`
and the add the `requirements.txt`
to your project folder. The following changes are necessary in `rxconfig.py`:

```python
config = rx.Config(
    app_name="app",
    api_url="http://app.example.com:8000",
)
```

Notice that the `api_url` should be set to the externally accessible hostname or
IP, as the client browser must be able to connect to it directly to establish
interactivity.

You can find the `requirements.txt` in the `docker-example` folder of the
project too.

The project structure should looks like this:

```bash
hello
├── .web
├── assets
├── hello
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── hello.py
├── rxconfig.py
├── Dockerfile
└── requirements.txt
```

After all changes have been made, the container image can now be created as follows.

```bash
docker build -t reflex-project:latest .
```

Finally, you can start your Reflex container service as follows.

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 8000:8000 --name app reflex-project:latest
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
```

# Tokens

A token gives someone else all the permissions you have as a User or Admin. They can run any Reflex Cloud command from the CLI as if they were you, using the `--token` flag. A common use case is for GitHub Actions (you store this token in your secrets).

To access or create tokens, first click the avatar in the top-right corner to open the drop-down menu, then click `Account Settings`.

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/hosting_tokens_1.png", alt="Adding tokens to Reflex Cloud", padding="1em 0em"))
```

Clicking `Account Settings` will redirect you to both the `Settings` and `Tokens` dashboards. Click the `Tokens` tab at the top to access your tokens or create new ones.


```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/hosting_tokens_2.png", alt="Adding tokens to Reflex Cloud", padding="1em 0em"))
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Client-storage

You can use the browser's local storage to persist state between sessions.
This allows user preferences, authentication cookies, other bits of information
to be stored on the client and accessed from different browser tabs.

A client-side storage var looks and acts like a normal `str` var, except the
default value is either `rx.Cookie` or `rx.LocalStorage` depending on where the
value should be stored. The key name will be based on the var name, but this
can be overridden by passing `name="my_custom_name"` as a keyword argument.

For more information see [Browser Storage](/docs/api-reference/browser-storage/).

Try entering some values in the text boxes below and then load the page in a separate
tab or check the storage section of browser devtools to see the values saved in the browser.

```python demo exec
class ClientStorageState(rx.State):
    my_cookie: str = rx.Cookie("")
    my_local_storage: str = rx.LocalStorage("")
    custom_cookie: str = rx.Cookie(name="CustomNamedCookie", max_age=3600)

    @rx.event
    def set_my_cookie(self, value: str):
        self.my_cookie = value

    @rx.event
    def set_my_local_storage(self, value: str):
        self.my_local_storage = value

    @rx.event
    def set_custom_cookie(self, value: str):
        self.custom_cookie = value

def client_storage_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.hstack(rx.text("my_cookie"), rx.input(value=ClientStorageState.my_cookie, on_change=ClientStorageState.set_my_cookie)),
        rx.hstack(rx.text("my_local_storage"), rx.input(value=ClientStorageState.my_local_storage, on_change=ClientStorageState.set_my_local_storage)),
        rx.hstack(rx.text("custom_cookie"), rx.input(value=ClientStorageState.custom_cookie, on_change=ClientStorageState.set_custom_cookie)),
    )
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import styling
```

# Grid

A simple responsive grid layout. We specify the number of columns to the `grid_template_columns` property as a list. The grid will automatically adjust the number of columns based on the screen size.

For details, see the [responsive docs page]({styling.responsive.path}).

## Cards

```python demo
rx.grid(
    rx.foreach(
        rx.Var.range(12),
        lambda i: rx.card(f"Card {i + 1}", height="10vh"),
    ),
	gap="1rem",
    grid_template_columns=["1fr", "repeat(2, 1fr)", "repeat(2, 1fr)", "repeat(3, 1fr)", "repeat(4, 1fr)"],
    width="100%"
)
```

## Inset cards

```python demo
rx.grid(
	rx.foreach(
		rx.Var.range(12),
		lambda i: rx.card(
			rx.inset(
				rx.image(
					src="/reflex_banner.png",
					width="100%",
					height="auto",
				),
				side="top",
				pb="current"
			),
			rx.text(
				f"Card {i + 1}",
			),
		),
	),
	gap="1rem",
	grid_template_columns=["1fr", "repeat(2, 1fr)", "repeat(2, 1fr)", "repeat(3, 1fr)", "repeat(4, 1fr)"],
	width="100%"
)
```

# Multi-column and row layout

A simple responsive multi-column and row layout. We specify the number of columns/rows to the `flex_direction` property as a list. The layout will automatically adjust the number of columns/rows based on the screen size.

For details, see the [responsive docs page]({styling.responsive.path}).

## Column

```python demo
rx.flex(
	rx.box(bg=rx.color("accent", 3), width="100%", height="100%"),
	rx.box(bg=rx.color("accent", 5), width="100%", height="100%"),
	rx.box(bg=rx.color("accent", 7), width="100%", height="100%"),
	bg=rx.color("accent", 10),
	spacing="4",
	padding="1em",
	flex_direction=["column", "column", "row"],
	height="600px",
	width="100%",
)
```

```python demo
rx.flex(
	rx.box(bg=rx.color("accent", 3), width="100%", height="100%"),
	rx.box(bg=rx.color("accent", 5), width=["100%", "100%", "50%"], height=["50%", "50%", "100%"]),
	rx.box(bg=rx.color("accent", 7), width="100%", height="100%"),
	rx.box(bg=rx.color("accent", 9), width=["100%", "100%", "50%"], height=["50%", "50%", "100%"]),
	bg=rx.color("accent", 10),
	spacing="4",
	padding="1em",
	flex_direction=["column", "column", "row"],
	height="600px",
	width="100%",
)
```

## Row

```python demo
rx.flex(
	rx.flex(
		rx.box(bg=rx.color("accent", 3), width=["100%", "100%", "50%"], height="100%"),
		rx.box(bg=rx.color("accent", 5), width=["100%", "100%", "50%"], height="100%"),
		width="100%",
		height="100%",
		spacing="4",
		flex_direction=["column", "column", "row"],
	),
	rx.box(bg=rx.color("accent", 7), width="100%", height="50%"),
	rx.box(bg=rx.color("accent", 9), width="100%", height="50%"),
	bg=rx.color("accent", 10),
	spacing="4",
	padding="1em",
	flex_direction="column",
	height="600px",
	width="100%",
)
```

# Stats

Stats cards are used to display key metrics or data points. They are typically used in dashboards or admin panels.

## Variant 1

```python demo exec toggle

	change = "increase" if value > prev_value else "decrease"
	arrow_icon = "trending-up" if value > prev_value else "trending-down"
	arrow_color = "grass" if value > prev_value else "tomato"
	return rx.card(

# Top Banner

Top banners are used to highlight important information or features at the top of a page. They are typically designed to grab the user's attention and can be used for announcements, navigation, or key messages.

## Basic

# Navigation Bar

A navigation bar, also known as a navbar, is a common UI element found at the top of a webpage or application.
It typically provides links or buttons to the main sections of a website or application, allowing users to easily navigate and access the different pages.

Navigation bars are useful for web apps because they provide a consistent and intuitive way for users to navigate through the app.
Having a clear and consistent navigation structure can greatly improve the user experience by making it easy for users to find the information they need and access the different features of the app.

# Footer Bar

A footer bar is a common UI element located at the bottom of a webpage. It typically contains information about the website, such as contact details and links to other pages or sections of the site.

## Basic

```python demo exec toggle

# Chips

Chips are compact elements that represent small pieces of information, such as tags or categories. They are commonly used to select multiple items from a list or to filter content.

## Status

```python demo exec toggle
from reflex.components.radix.themes.base import LiteralAccentColor

status_chip_props = {
    "radius": "full",
    "variant": "outline",
    "size": "3",
}

def status_chip(status: str, icon: str, color: LiteralAccentColor) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.badge(
        rx.icon(icon, size=18),
        status,
        color_scheme=color,
        **status_chip_props,
    )

def status_chips_group() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.hstack(
        status_chip("Info", "info", "blue"),
        status_chip("Success", "circle-check", "green"),
        status_chip("Warning", "circle-alert", "yellow"),
        status_chip("Error", "circle-x", "red"),
        wrap="wrap",
		spacing="2",
    )
```

## Single selection

```python demo exec toggle
chip_props = {
    "radius": "full",
    "variant": "soft",
    "size": "3",
    "cursor": "pointer",
    "style": {"_hover": {"opacity": 0.75}},
}

available_items = ["2:00", "3:00", "4:00", "5:00"]

# Pricing Cards

A pricing card shows the price of a product or service. It typically includes a title, description, price, features, and a purchase button.

## Basic

```python demo exec toggle

        feature_item("Priority email support"),
        width="100%",

# Smart Checkboxes Group

A smart checkboxes group where you can track all checked boxes, as well as place a limit on how many checks are possible.

## Recipe

```python eval
rx.center(rx.image(src="/gallery/smart_checkboxes.gif"))
```

This recipe use a `dict[str, bool]` for the checkboxes state tracking.
Additionally, the limit that prevent the user from checking more boxes than allowed with a computed var.

```python
class CBoxeState(rx.State):
    
    choices: dict[str, bool] = \{k: False for k in ["Choice A", "Choice B", "Choice C"]}
    _check_limit = 2

    def check_choice(self, value, index):
        self.choices[index] = value

    @rx.var
    def choice_limit(self):
        return sum(self.choices.values()) >= self._check_limit

    @rx.var
    def checked_choices(self):
        choices = [l for l, v in self.choices.items() if v]
        return " / ".join(choices) if choices else "None"

When you **paste a URL directly into the AI Builder chat**, the AI will automatically decide how to handle it depending on your prompt.

You can use URLs to **copy a page’s design** or **extract its content**, without needing to set up any integration.

## How It Works

* If you say something like **“copy the design”** or **“use this layout”**, the AI will:

  * Take a **screenshot** of the page.
  * Use it as a **visual reference** to recreate the UI in your app.
  * Allow you to **customize** the generated design afterward.

* 🪄 If you say something like **“get the content”**, **“scrape this page”**, or just paste the URL without mentioning design, the AI will:

  * **Scrape the content** of the page (text, links, images, metadata).
  * Return it as structured data that can be used in components, workflows, or AI actions.

## Example Prompts

* “Copy the design of this page.”
* “Scrape the content from this blog post.”
* “Get all the product details from this URL.”
* (Paste the URL alone) → AI will assume content scraping by default.

## Notes

* **Public pages only:** The AI can only process URLs that are publicly accessible.
* **Editable:** Both the generated design and scraped content can be modified after processing.



# API Integration

Not every service has a first-class integration — but your app can connect to **any external API** directly. By using standard HTTP requests, you can integrate with virtually any platform, fetch or send data, and trigger workflows without needing a prebuilt connector.

This gives you full flexibility to work with modern REST, GraphQL, or other web APIs.

## What You Can Do

With custom API calls, your app can:
- Connect to **any REST or GraphQL API** on the web.  
- **Send and receive data** from external services.  
- Trigger actions like creating records, sending messages, or fetching analytics.  
- Build **custom automations** and workflows around APIs.  
- Chain API calls with other integrations or AI actions for powerful flows.

## Step 1: Get API Access

1. Identify the service you want to connect to.  
2. Check its developer documentation for API access requirements.  
3. Obtain the necessary credentials (e.g., **API key**, **token**, or **OAuth**).  
4. Store credentials securely using environment variables — **never** hardcode secrets.

   *Example:*  
   - **API Key:** `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`  
   - **Base URL:** `https://api.example.com/v1/`

## Step 2: Hook up with your App

1. In the AI Builder navigate to the `secrets` tab and add your API credentials as secrets.
2. Then prompt the AI to use these secrets to do what you want and it will install the necessary libraries and set up the API calls for you.

## Step 3: Notes

* **Keep secrets safe:** Use environment variables or secret storage for API keys.
* **Check rate limits:** Many APIs have request limits — build accordingly.
* **Combine with AI or other integrations:** For example, fetch data via API and summarize it using an LLM.


With API integrations, you can connect your app to **almost any modern platform or service**, giving you unlimited extensibility beyond native integrations.




# Webhooks

Webhooks allow your app to **send data to external services** in real time. You provide the AI Builder with a **webhook URL** created in another platform, and it can **automatically send payloads** to that URL when workflows are triggered.

This is a simple and powerful way to integrate with services that support incoming webhooks, even if there’s no first-class integration.

## What You Can Do

With outgoing webhooks, your app can:

* **Send structured payloads** to any service that supports incoming webhooks (e.g., Slack, Zapier, Make, Discord).
* **Trigger external workflows** when events happen in your app.
* **Push real-time updates** to third-party systems without writing custom backend code.
* Chain webhook calls with other integrations or AI actions.

## Step 1: Create a Webhook in the External Service

1. Go to the external service you want to connect (e.g., Slack, Zapier, Discord, Make).
2. Create a new **incoming webhook** in that service.
3. Copy the **webhook URL** it provides.


## Step 2: Add the Webhook URL to AI Builder

1. In the AI Builder chat paste the **webhook URL** you created in the external service.
2. You can then instruct the AI to **send data to this URL** whenever a workflow is triggered.
3. Optionally define the **payload structure** (e.g., JSON body) and when it should be sent.

> 💡 Example: “Send user signup data to this webhook whenever a user signs up.”

## Step 3: Sending Payloads

* The AI Builder will write the code to send a `POST` request to the webhook URL with the payload you define.
* The payload can include **dynamic data** from your app — such as user info, state variables, or model outputs.
* You can trigger these webhook calls from buttons, events, workflows, or automations.


## Step 4: Notes

* **Security:** Only use webhook URLs from trusted services — they will receive your data as-is.
* **Formatting:** Make sure the payload matches the expected format of the external service.
* **Chaining:** You can use multiple webhooks or combine them with other integrations.
* **Use cases:** Slack alerts, CRM updates, triggering automations in Zapier or Make, notifying custom systems.



# Python Libraries


Not every service or tool has a first-class integration — but your app can still connect to **any Python library** directly. By leveraging the built-in Python runtime, the AI Builder can install packages, import libraries, and call their functions from workflows or components. This gives you maximum flexibility to extend your app with the broader Python ecosystem.

When you ask for a certain functionality the AI Builder will first check if there is a `first-class integration` available. If not, it will `search the web` to try and find a relevant Python library to fulfill your request. If it finds one, it will install the package and ask you to set any `API keys` that are required.


## Example Use Cases

### Slack 

There is no built-in integration for Slack. But if you ask the AI Builder to send a message to a Slack channel, it will research itself the best implementation and then use the `slack_sdk` Python package to send the message.


### Scikit-learn

There is no built-in integration for Scikit-learn. But if you ask the AI Builder to classify some text using scikit-learn, it will research itself the best implementation and then use the `scikit-learn` Python package to load a pre-trained model and classify the text.




## Adding Custom Knowledge

If you are working with a specialized / less well-known library, you can add custom knowledge to help the AI Builder understand how to use it. Simply provide a brief description of the library, its purpose, and example usage in the **Knowledge** section of your app settings. This will guide the AI Builder when it attempts to call functions from that library.

```md alert warning
# Where to find the Knowledge Section

![Where to find the Knowledge Section](/ai_builder/find_knowledge_tab.webp)
```


## What is Not Supported

There are a very small number of libraries that are not supported due to their size. For example, large machine learning frameworks like `torch` or `tensorflow` are not supported directly. In these cases, we recommend using a first-class integration that can emulate similar functionality (e.g., the Replicate integration for running ML models in the cloud).

# Integrations Shortcut

Reflex Build supports powerful integrations like databases, OpenAI, and Databricks, allowing you to connect external services to your app without complex setup. These integrations help you add advanced functionality—like AI-powered features, data analytics, or persistent storage—while speeding up development.

The **Add Integrations** button makes it easy to connect external services to your app while chatting with the AI Builder. A panel with a list of available integrations will appear, you can quickly add integrations that your app can reference and connect to.

Once in your app, you can access your integrations by clicking the flow or cog icon in the bottom left inside the chat area.

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
```

```python eval
rx.el.div(
    image_zoom(
        rx.image(
            src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                "/ai_builder/features/shortcut_light.webp",
                "/ai_builder/features/shortcut_dark.webp",
            ),
            class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
            border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
        ),
        class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
    ),
    class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
)
```

## How to Use

1. In the AI Builder home, click the **Add Integrations** button. And if you're already in an app, click the flow or cog icon in the bottom left inside the chat area.
2. A list of available integrations will appear (e.g. Database, Databricks, OpenAI, etc.).
3. Click the Add button next to an integration to select it.
4. The integration will be added to your app and becomes available for connection. Then you can fill the required fields for the integration.
5. The AI Builder now knows your app has access to this integration and can generate code that uses it.

## What It Does

- **Quick Access** – Easily browse and select from available integrations.
- **Automatic Connection** – Integrations are added to your app and become available for the AI to use in generated code.
- **No Manual Setup** – Skip complex configuration—the AI Builder handles the integration setup for you.

## Common Use Cases

- **Database Queries**
  Show me the top 10 users ordered by signup date from my database.

- **AI Features**
  Create a chat application that uses OpenAI to generate responses.

from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
```

The Github integration is important to make sure that you don't lose your progress. It also allows you to revert to previous versions of your app.


```python eval
rx.image(
    src="/ai_builder/connecting_to_github.gif",
    height="auto",
    padding_bottom="2rem",
)
```

The GitHub integration allows you to:

- Save your app progress
- Work on your code locally and push your local changes back to Reflex.Build


## Github Commit History

The commit history is a great way to see the changes that you have made to your app. You can also revert to previous versions of your app from here.

```python eval
image_zoom(rx.image(src="/ai_builder/github_commit_history.png"))
```


# Knowledge

The **Knowledge** feature lets you add context or rules that the AI Builder can reference when generating apps. This ensures your apps follow your guidelines, standards, or specific business logic.

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom

def render_image():
    return rx.el.div(
        image_zoom(
            rx.image(
                src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                    "/ai_builder/features/knowledge_light.webp",
                    "/ai_builder/features/knowledge_dark.webp",
                ),
                class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
                border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
            ),
            class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
        ),
        class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
    )
```

```python eval

rx.el.div(render_image())

```

## How to Add Knowledge

1. In the AI Builder workspace, go to the **Knowledge** section by clicking the **`Context`** button in the bottom bar, and then on the top bar click the **`Knowledge`** tab.
2. Enter your rule, guideline, or context description.
3. Save the entry. The AI Builder will automatically use it when generating apps.

## How It Works

- The AI Builder references your knowledge entries as rules or guidelines.
- Rules can define naming conventions, component usage, layout preferences, or other custom logic.
- Multiple rules can be added to cover different aspects of app generation.

## Common Use Cases

- **Maintain Consistency**
  Ensure all generated apps follow your company’s design or naming standards.

- **Enforce Business Logic**
  Guide the AI Builder to follow specific workflows, validations, or feature requirements.

- **Quickly Adapt AI Behavior**
  Add or update rules to influence new app generations without manual edits.


# AI Testing Feature

## Overview

The Testing feature allows you to automatically test your generated applications for common issues and functionality problems. The AI will analyze your app and identify potential bugs, broken links, navigation issues, and other problems.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
```

```python eval
rx.el.div(
    image_zoom(
        rx.image(
            src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                "/ai_builder/features/test_light.webp",
                "/ai_builder/features/test_dark.webp",
            ),
            class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
            border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
        ),
        class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
    ),
    class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
)
```

## How to Use

1. **Start Testing**: Type "test this app" or similar command to activate testing mode
2. **AI Analysis**: The AI will automatically switch to testing mode and begin analyzing your application
3. **Review Results**: The preview tab switches to "Testing" mode to show the testing process and results

## What Gets Tested

The AI automatically checks for:

- **Broken Navigation**: Links that don't work or lead to missing pages

- **Time Saving**: Automated testing is faster than manual checking
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests multiple aspects of your application


# Secrets

The **Secrets** feature allows you to securely store environment-specific values that your app can use, such as API keys, tokens, or other sensitive information.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom

def render_image():
    return rx.el.div(
        image_zoom(
            rx.image(
                src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                    "/ai_builder/features/secrets_light.webp",
                    "/ai_builder/features/secrets_dark.webp",
                ),
                class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
                border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
            ),
            class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
        ),
        class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
    )
```

```python eval

rx.el.div(render_image())

```

## Adding Secrets

### 1. Add Individually
- **Description:** Set a single secret by providing a key and value.
- **Example:**
  - Key: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - Value: `sk-xxxxxx`
- **Behavior:** The secret is encrypted and accessible to your app at runtime.

### 2. Add in Bulk (Raw Editor)
- **Description:** Upload multiple secrets at once using a simple `VAR=VALUE` format.
- **Example:**

```text
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxx
```

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
```

```python eval
rx.el.div(
    image_zoom(
        rx.image(
            src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                "/ai_builder/features/secret_bulk_light.webp",
                "/ai_builder/features/secret_bulk_dark.webp",
            ),
            class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
            border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
        ),
        class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
    ),
    class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
)
```


- **Behavior:** Each secret is securely stored and immediately available in the app environment.


# Editor Modes

The AI Builder includes a powerful dual-mode editor that lets you view and edit your application code while tracking changes made by the AI. You can seamlessly switch between **Editor Mode** for manual code editing and **Diff Mode** for reviewing AI-generated changes.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom

def render_image():
    return rx.el.div(
        image_zoom(
            rx.image(
                src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                    "/ai_builder/features/diff_light.webp",
                    "/ai_builder/features/diff_dark.webp",
                ),
                class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
                border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
            ),
            class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
        ),
        class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
    )
```

```python eval

rx.el.div(render_image())

```
## Modes: Editor vs Diff

### Editor Mode
The standard code editor where you can:
- **Write and modify code** directly in the interface
- **Navigate through files** using the file tree
- **Make manual changes** to your application
- **Save your modifications** which persist across sessions

### Diff Mode
A specialized view that highlights changes from the last AI prompt:
- **Green highlights** show code additions made by the AI
- **Red highlights** show code deletions made by the AI
- **Side-by-side comparison** of what changed
- **Line-by-line tracking** of modifications

## Switching Between Modes

### Toggle Controls
Located in the editor toolbar, you'll find:
- **Editor** button - Switch to normal editing mode
- **Diff** button - Switch to change tracking mode

### When to Use Each Mode
- **Use Editor Mode when:**
  - Making manual code changes
  - Writing new functionality
  - Debugging or fixing issues
  - General code development

- **Use Diff Mode when:**
  - Reviewing what the AI changed after a prompt
  - Understanding modifications before accepting them
  - Tracking the impact of AI suggestions
  - Learning from AI-generated code patterns

## Understanding Diff Visualizations

### Code Highlighting
**Additions (Green):**
- New code lines added by the AI
- New functions, components, or logic
- Enhanced features and improvements

**Deletions (Red):**
- Code removed by the AI
- Replaced or refactored sections
- Deprecated functionality

### File Tree Indicators
The file tree shows change statistics for each modified file:

**Change Indicators:**
- **`+5`** - 5 lines added to this file
- **`-3`** - 3 lines removed from this file
- **`+12 -8`** - 12 lines added, 8 lines removed
- **No indicator** - File unchanged

**Visual Cues:**
- **Green `+` symbol** indicates files with additions
- **Red `-` symbol** indicates files with deletions

# Installing External Packages

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

Reflex Build allows you to install external python packages to use in your app. This is useful if you want to use a package that is not included in the default Reflex Build environment. Examples might include `openai`, `langsmith`, `requests`, etc.

There are two ways to install external packages:

1. **Through the Chat Interface**: You can ask the AI to install a package for you.
2. **Add to the `requirements.txt` file**: You can add the package to the `requirements.txt` file and then save the app. This will install the package in your app's environment.

## Installing through the Chat Interface

Enter the name of the package you want to install in the chat interface. The AI will then install the package for you.

```python eval
rx.image(
    src="/ai_builder/external_packages_input.gif",
    height="auto",
    padding_bottom="2rem",
)
```


## Installing through the requirements.txt file

Add the package to the `requirements.txt` file and then save the app. This will install the package in your app's environment and recompile your app.

```python eval
rx.image(
    src="/ai_builder/external_packages_requirements.gif",
    height="auto",
    padding_bottom="2rem",
)
```

# Use Images as a prompt

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

Uploading an image (screenshot) of a website (web) app of what you are looking to build gives the AI really good context. 

*This is the recommended way to start an app generation.*


Below is a GIF showing how to upload an image to the AI Builder:

```python eval
rx.image(
    src="/ai_builder/image_upload.gif",
    height="auto",
    padding_bottom="2rem",
)
```

The advised prompt to use is:

`Build an app from a reference image`

# Restore Checkpoint

The **Restore Checkpoint** feature allows you to roll back your app to any previous state during your AI Builder conversation. This is useful when you want to undo recent changes and return to an earlier version of your app.

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
```

```python eval
rx.el.div(
    image_zoom(
        rx.image(
            src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                "/ai_builder/features/restore_light.webp",
                "/ai_builder/features/restore_dark.webp",
            ),
            class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
            border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
        ),
        class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
    ),
    class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
)
```

## How It Works

Every time the AI agent makes changes to your app, a checkpoint is automatically created. You can restore to any of these checkpoints at any time, effectively undoing all changes made after that point.

## Using Restore Checkpoint

1. **Locate the Restore Icon**: At the end of each AI agent message that made changes to your app, you'll see a circular arrow icon (↻).

2. **Click to Restore**: Click the circular arrow icon next to the message you want to restore to.

3. **Confirm the Action**: The app will restore to the exact state it was in after that specific message was processed.

4. **Continue Building**: After restoring, you can continue the conversation and make new changes from that point.

## When to Use Restore Checkpoint

- **Undo Unwanted Changes**: When the AI made changes you don't like
- **Try Different Approaches**: Restore and ask the AI to implement a feature differently
- **Fix Broken Functionality**: Roll back when new changes break existing features
- **Experiment Safely**: Test different solutions knowing you can always restore to a checkpoint

## Important Notes

- Restoring will **permanently delete** all changes made after the selected message
- You cannot undo a restore operation - choose your restore point carefully
- The conversation history remains intact, but code changes after the restore point are lost
- Restore checkpoint only affects your current building session

> **Tip:** Before making major changes, note which message represents your last stable checkpoint so you can easily restore if needed.


# App Style Customization

## Overview

The App Style feature allows you to customize the visual appearance of your AI-generated applications. You can choose from predefined design themes or create custom styling to match your brand and preferences.

## How to Use

1. **Access the Feature**: Click on the App Style option to open the customization panel
2. **Choose Your Approach**:
   - **Custom**: Manually configure individual design elements
   - **Themes**: Select from professionally designed templates

# Reflex Build: Best Practices

> A comprehensive guide to working effectively with AI Builder. This guide outlines how to get the most reliable and efficient results when working with the AI Builder inside Reflex Build. The key to success is clarity, structure, and iteration.

---

## Core Workflow

### Foundation: Planning Before You Build

Before jumping into the AI Builder, take time to plan your approach. Good preparation leads to better results and fewer iterations.

- **Define your core purpose and users** — Write a 2-3 sentence app description and identify your target users and their needs.
- **Prioritize 3-5 key features** — Focus on the most important functionality first, then expand from there.
- **Gather visual references** — Collect screenshots, wireframes, or sketches of layouts you want to emulate.
- **Structure your data** — List what information each page needs to display and how users will interact with it.
- **Start with your most important page** — Usually your main dashboard, home screen, or primary workflow. Get this right first.

### Auto-Generate Prompts from App Specs

To save time and get higher-quality prompts, you can feed your full app spec into **Chat Mode** and ask it to break the spec into structured, build-ready prompts.

Chat Mode can translate your vision into:

- Layout instructions
- UI component definitions
- Data model requirements
- Styling preferences
- Follow-up test plans

Once generated, copy each prompt into the AI Builder to execute them in sequence.

**Example workflow:**

1. Switch to Chat Mode and paste your full app specification
2. Ask **"Break this into a series of buildable prompts I can feed into the Agent Mode."**
3. Copy each generated prompt into Agent Mode one by one
4. Build iteratively using the structured prompts

### Working with Text Specifications

If you have a structured app specification, don't paste the entire document into the builder at once. Break it down into logical sections and feed them in sequence.

**Pro tip:** Use **Chat Mode** to help prepare prompts:

Paste your full app spec and ask:

  - **"Break this into buildable prompts I can feed into the builder."**
  - **"Write one prompt per feature/page to build this app."**

This hybrid approach — planning in **Chat Mode**, then building in **Agent Mode** — lets you move faster and build smarter.

### Writing Clear, Task-Oriented Prompts

The AI performs best when it receives **specific, outcome-driven instructions**. Avoid vague, broad prompts.


```diff
- Build me an admin dashboard. # <- Bad
+ Create a 2-column layout with a sidebar for navigation and a top navbar. # <- Good
```

Whenever possible, split large tasks into smaller steps:

- Define the layout first (columns, rows, sidebar)
- Add UI components (buttons, inputs, modals)
- Handle data models and states later
- Use follow-ups to style and polish

Use precise styling language, for example:

```diff
- Grid items have small spacing and sharp corners.
+ Add medium spacing between grid items and use large rounded corners on cards.
```

Avoid subjective terms like "**nice**," "**modern**," or "**clean**." Treat your prompt as interface documentation for the builder.

### Working with Images and Visual References

You can drop in screenshots of websites, dashboards, apps, or even hand-drawn wireframes. The builder will extract layout, design, and functionality ideas from these images.

**Tips for images:**

- Clear screenshots work best
- Include any elements you want: forms, tables, nav, charts
- You can annotate them with arrows, notes, or labels

**Get UI/UX feedback using Chat Mode:**

Upload a screenshot and ask: **"What are 5 things I could do to improve the UI/UX of this?"**


Follow up with: **Implement items 1, 2, and 4 in the builder.**

Or request specific improvements: **Make this more minimal and mobile-first.**

---

## Optimizing Your Workflow

### Building Iteratively

Trying to generate your full app in a single prompt almost never works well. Instead, approach your build in clear stages:

1. **Layout** — Grid, Flex, responsive columns/rows
2. **Components** — Tables, buttons, modals, charts, etc.
3. **State** — Bindings, stores, mock data
4. **Refinement** — Tweaks, visual polish, edge case handling

At each stage, give feedback and iterate. If the AI builder makes something close, you can say:

```diff
- Modal is included and sidebar is static.
+ Remove modal and make sidebar collapsible.

- Buttons vary across pages.
+ Use same button style from home page.

- Card layout differs across sections.
+ Repeat card layout from dashboard section.
```


### Improving UI/UX

To improve your design, ask the builder for more polished layouts, better structure, or more modern styles.

```diff
- Layout feels cluttered with small headings and dense sections.
+ Increase heading sizes and spacing between sections for better hierarchy.

- Navigation buttons are inconsistent.
+ Standardize button sizes and colors for consistent UX.
```

**Suggested workflow:**

1. In Chat Mode, upload an image or describe the layout.
2. Ask: **"Tell me 5 things that would improve the UI/UX of this page."**
3. Review the suggestions and decide which ones you want to apply.
4. Switch to Agent Mode and implement: **"Improve visual hierarchy by increasing heading sizes and adding more spacing between sections."**

### Using Knowledge to Guide the Build

The **Knowledge** panel lets you provide long-form references that influence how the agent builds your app. Add design systems, style guides, brand guidelines, or architecture rules.

Once added, the builder will try to honor these rules throughout the session, ensuring consistency without repeating instructions.

Try combining Knowledge with Chat Mode:

  - **Use the style guide in Knowledge to improve this page.**

  - **Is the current layout aligned with our design system in Knowledge?**


### Local Development Integration

We have an MCP server available for enterprise customers to connect local AI development tools such as Claude Desktop, Windsurf, or Codex.

This enables a hybrid workflow: generate your app and make major changes in the App Builder, then move to local development for detailed refinements and custom functionality.

> **Enterprise Feature:** The Reflex MCP integration is currently only available for enterprise customers. [Book a demo](https://reflex.dev/pricing/) to discuss access.

#### Quick Setup

**Prerequisites:**

- MCP-compatible AI tool (Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Codex)
- Valid Reflex account for OAuth authentication
- Internet connection to the hosted MCP server

**Benefits:**

- **Seamless handoff** — Move between web builder and local development
- **AI-powered local development** — Use your preferred AI tools with Reflex projects
- **No local installation** — Hosted MCP server requires no additional Python packages
- **Secure authentication** — OAuth 2.1 integration with your Reflex account

For complete setup instructions for Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Codex, and other MCP clients, visit our [MCP integration](https://reflex.dev/docs/ai-builder/integrations/mcp-installation/) documentation.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Plan before you build**. A few minutes of preparation saves hours of iteration.
- **Think modularly**. Focus on atomic parts before the full system.
- **Write like a designer-developer**. Clear, structural, and functional language wins.
- **Iterate continuously**. Let each prompt get you 80% there, then refine.

With these techniques, the AI Builder becomes a reliable extension of your creative and technical intent.


# Your First Reflex Build App

In this tutorial, you'll build a data dashboard application that displays employee information in both table and chart formats, with interactive features for filtering and adding new data. We'll also add a simple chatbot page to demonstrate multi-page navigation.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created:
- A dashboard displaying employee data in a table and bar chart
- Interactive filtering to search through your data
- A modal form for adding new employees
- A separate page with a simple chatbot interface

This tutorial assumes you're starting with a new project in AI Builder.

---

## Creating Your Dashboard

Let's start by building the core of our application - a dashboard that displays employee data.

**Prompt:**
```
Create a dashboard page with a table showing sample employee data with columns: Name, Department, and Salary. Below the table, add a bar chart that visualizes the salary data. Include at least 5 sample employees with different departments and salary ranges.
```

This will create your main dashboard page with both tabular and visual representations of your data. The AI will generate sample employee records and create a bar chart that makes it easy to compare salaries across your team.

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
```

```python eval
rx.el.div(
    image_zoom(
        rx.image(
            src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                "/ai_builder/overview/tutorial_1_light.webp",
                "/ai_builder/overview/tutorial_1_dark.webp",
            ),
            class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
            border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
        ),
        class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
    ),
    class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
)
```

## Adding Interactive Filtering

Now that you have your basic dashboard, let's make it more interactive by adding the ability to filter and search through your employee data.

**Prompt:**
```
Add filtering functionality to the employee table. Include a search input above the table that filters rows based on name, and dropdown filters for department. Make sure the filters work together and update the table in real-time.
```

Your dashboard now becomes much more useful with real-time filtering. Users can quickly find specific employees by name or narrow down results by department. The filters work together, so you can combine a department filter with a name search.

```python eval
rx.el.div(
    image_zoom(
        rx.image(
            src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                "/ai_builder/overview/tutorial_2_light.webp",
                "/ai_builder/overview/tutorial_2_dark.webp",
            ),
            class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
            border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
        ),
        class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
    ),
    class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
)
```


## Enabling Data Entry

A static dashboard is useful, but being able to add new data makes your app much more practical. Let's add the ability to create new employee records.

**Prompt:**
```
Add an "Add Employee" button above the table. When clicked, open a modal with input fields for Name, Department, and Salary. When the form is submitted, add the new employee to the table and update the bar chart. Include form validation for required fields.
```

Your app now has full CRUD capability for employee records. The modal form provides a clean interface for data entry, and both your table and chart update immediately when new employees are added.


```python eval
rx.el.div(
    image_zoom(
        rx.image(
            src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                "/ai_builder/overview/tutorial_3_light.webp",
                "/ai_builder/overview/tutorial_3_dark.webp",
            ),
            class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
            border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
        ),
        class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
    ),
    class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
)
```


## Building a Multi-Page App

Most real applications have multiple pages. Let's add a chatbot page to demonstrate navigation and create a more complete user experience.

**Prompt:**
```
Create a new page called "Chat" and add it to the navigation. Build a simple chatbot interface with a message input field, send button, and chat history display. For now, make the bot echo back the user's messages with "Bot says: [user message]".
```

Your app now has proper navigation between the dashboard and chat functionality. The chatbot page demonstrates how easy it is to add new features and pages to your AI Builder application.


```python eval
rx.el.div(
    image_zoom(
        rx.image(
            src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                "/ai_builder/overview/tutorial_4_light.webp",
                "/ai_builder/overview/tutorial_4_dark.webp",
            ),
            class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
            border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
        ),
        class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
    ),
    class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
)
```

## What's Next?

You've successfully built a complete web application with data visualization, interactive filtering, data entry, and multi-page navigation. Your app demonstrates many common patterns used in modern web applications:

- **Data presentation** with tables and charts
- **User interaction** through filtering and forms
- **Real-time updates** when data changes
- **Multi-page architecture** with navigation

## Exploring Further

Now that you have a working foundation, try experimenting with these ideas:

- **Customize the data model** - change the employee fields or add new columns
- **Enhance the visualizations** - try different chart types or add more charts
- **Improve the chatbot** - give it more sophisticated responses or integrate it with your employee data
- **Add more pages** - create additional features like employee profiles or reporting dashboards

The power of AI Builder is that you can iterate quickly with natural language prompts. Each new feature is just a conversation away!

## Feature Overview

Reflex Build provides a streamlined interface for building AI applications. The **Project Menu Bar** helps you manage sessions and stored variables, while the **Chat Area** displays real-time prompts, edits, and file generations. The **Application Workspace** organizes your project structure, and the **Code Editor** allows direct, instant code editing. Key actions like deploy and share are accessible via the **Bottom Menu Bar**, and the **Preview Tab** lets you view and interact with your live app at any time.

```python eval
rx.el.div(
    _docs_app_sections_small_screen(),
)
```

## Interface Highlights

Reflex Build’s interface is designed for clarity and efficiency. The **Project Menu Bar** helps you manage sessions, apps, and variables. The **Chat Area** shows prompts in action with visual feedback and file generation. In the **Application Workspace**, you can view and organize your project files. The **Code Editor** allows quick, direct edits with instant saving. Use the **Bottom Menu Bar** for key actions like deploy and download. The **Preview Tab** lets you interact with a live version of your app, including refresh and full-screen options.

```python eval
rx.el.div(
    rx.el.div(_docs_features(), class_name=screen_normalization),
)
```


# Templates

Reflex has many certified templates, seen on the `Trending` tab of the Reflex Build, that can be used to kickstart your app.

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
```

```python eval
rx.el.div(
    image_zoom(
        rx.image(
            src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                "/ai_builder/overview/templates_light.webp",
                "/ai_builder/overview/templates_dark.webp",
            ),
            class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
            border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
        ),
        class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
    ),
    class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
)
```

## Using a Template

To use a template, simply click the template and then in the bottom right corner of the app click the `Fork` button. This will create a copy of the template in your own account. You can then edit the app as you like with further prompting.

```python eval
rx.el.div(
    image_zoom(
        rx.image(
            src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                "/ai_builder/overview/fork_template_light.webp",
                "/ai_builder/overview/fork_template_dark.webp",
            ),
            class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
            border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
        ),
        class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
    ),
    class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
)
```

Templates are great to get started if they have similar UI to what you are looking to build. You can then add your own data to the app.


# General App Settings

The **General App Settings** section lets you manage key aspects of your app, including its name, ID, and deletion. This is your central place to view and update your app’s core information.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom

def render_image():
    return rx.el.div(
        image_zoom(
            rx.image(
                src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                    "/ai_builder/app_lifecycle/general_light.webp",
                    "/ai_builder/app_lifecycle/general_dark.webp",
                ),
                class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
                border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
            ),
            class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
        ),
        class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
    )
```

```python eval

rx.el.div(render_image())

```


## How to Access Settings

1. In the AI Builder workspace, click the **Settings** icon located at the bottom-left of the screen, inside the chat box area.
2. This will open the **General** tab to see your app’s main settings.

## What You Can Do

- **Change App Name**
  Update the name of your app to reflect its purpose or version.

- **View App ID**
  Find the unique identifier for your app, which can be used for integrations or support.

- **Delete App**
  Permanently remove an app you no longer need. **Warning:** This action cannot be undone.


# Copy App

The **Copy** feature lets you duplicate an existing app inside Reflex Build.
This is useful when you want to experiment with changes without affecting the original project, or when you want to use an app as a starting point for a new idea.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom

def render_image():
    return rx.el.div(
        image_zoom(
            rx.image(
                src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                    "/ai_builder/app_lifecycle/copy_light.webp",
                    "/ai_builder/app_lifecycle/copy_dark.webp",
                ),
                class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
                border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
            ),
            class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
        ),
        class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
    )
```

```python eval

rx.el.div(render_image())

```

## How to Copy an App

1. In the Reflex Build workspace, click the **Copy** button (bottom-right corner).
2. Reflex Build will create a new app in your workspace with the same:
   - Code files and components
   - State and configuration
   - Dependencies

The copied app will appear as a separate project, independent from the original.


## Common Use Cases

- **Experiment Safely**
  Try out new components, layouts, or integrations without risking your working app.

- **Create Variations**
  Use the original app as a base to quickly spin up a different version (e.g., a light and dark theme version).

- **Template Reuse**
  Turn an app into a personal template and copy it each time you start a new project.

## Best Practices

- Rename your copied app immediately so it’s easy to distinguish from the original.


# Deploy App

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

It is easy to deploy your app into production from Reflex Build to Reflex Cloud.

Simply click the `Deploy` button in the bottom right corner of Reflex Build, as shown below:



```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom

def render_image():
    return rx.el.div(
        image_zoom(
            rx.image(
                src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                    "/ai_builder/app_lifecycle/deploy_light.webp",
                    "/ai_builder/app_lifecycle/deploy_dark.webp",
                ),
                class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
                border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
            ),
            class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
        ),
        class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
    )
```

```python eval

rx.el.div(render_image())

```

When deploying you can set the following options:
- **App Name**: The name of your app
- **Hostname**: Set your url by setting your hostname, i.e. if you set `myapp` as your hostname, your app will be available at `myapp.reflex.run`
- **Region**: The regions where your app will be deployed
- **VM Size**: The size of the VM where your app will be deployed
- **Secrets**: The environment variables that will be set for your app, you can load the variables currently being used by your app by clicking the `Load from settings` button

Note: Hostname customization, region selection, and VM sizing are only available on paid plans.


# Download App

You can download your Reflex Build project if you want to work on it locally or self-host it outside the AI Builder.

**Tip:** The recommended workflow is to use the GitHub integration, which keeps your code version-controlled and in sync. Downloading is useful if GitHub integration isn’t available or you just want a one-time export.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom

def render_image():
    return rx.el.div(
        image_zoom(
            rx.image(
                src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                    "/ai_builder/app_lifecycle/download_light.webp",
                    "/ai_builder/app_lifecycle/download_dark.webp",
                ),
                class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
                border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
            ),
            class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
        ),
        class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
    )
```

```python eval

rx.el.div(render_image())

```

## How to Download

1. In the AI Builder workspace, go to the **bottom-right corner**.
2. Click the **Download** button.
3. A `.zip` file will be generated containing your entire Reflex app, including:
   - Source code (`.py` files, components, state, etc.)
   - `requirements.txt` with dependencies
   - Config files (`rxconfig.py`, `.env`, etc.)


# Fork App

The **Fork App** feature lets you take an existing app and create your own version of it. This is perfect for **experimenting, customizing, or building on top of someone else’s work** without affecting the original app.

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
```

```python eval
rx.el.div(
    image_zoom(
        rx.image(
            src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                "/ai_builder/overview/fork_template_light.webp",
                "/ai_builder/overview/fork_template_dark.webp",
            ),
            class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
            border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
        ),
        class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
    ),
    class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
)
```


## How to Fork an App

1. Browse or open an app you’d like to use as a starting point.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the app’s bottom right corner.
3. The AI Builder will create a **copy of the app** in your workspace.
4. You can now **edit, customize, and expand** your forked app independently of the original.

## What Happens When You Fork

- You get a **full copy** of the original app, including all pages, components, and configurations.
- The forked app is **completely separate**, so changes you make do not affect the original.
- You can **rename, deploy, or share** your forked app like any other app in your workspace.

## Common Use Cases

- **Start From an Example**
  Use a sample or shared app as a foundation to save time and learn best practices.

- **Experiment Safely**
  Try new ideas or features without risking changes to the original app.

- **Collaborate and Customize**
  Fork a teammate’s app to tailor it to your needs while keeping the original intact.


# Share App

The **Share** feature makes it easy to show your app to others without deploying it.
When you share, Reflex Build generates a unique link that points to the current version of your project in the builder.

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom

def render_image():
    return rx.el.div(
        image_zoom(
            rx.image(
                src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                    "/ai_builder/app_lifecycle/share_light.webp",
                    "/ai_builder/app_lifecycle/share_dark.webp",
                ),
                class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
                border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
            ),
            class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
        ),
        class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
    )
```

```python eval

rx.el.div(render_image())

```

## How to Share

1. In the AI Builder workspace, click the **Share** button (bottom-right corner).
2. A popup will appear with a **shareable link**.
3. Copy the link and send it to teammates, collaborators, or stakeholders.


## What Others See

- The link opens a **read-only view** of your app generation.
- Recipients can see the app preview but cannot make edits.
- This makes it safe to share work-in-progress versions for quick feedback.


## Common Use Cases

- **Get Feedback Quickly**
  Share a work-in-progress version with your team before deploying.

- **Demo Features**
  Send a link to showcase a new component, layout, or integration.

- **Collaboration**
  Share context with another developer before handing off to GitHub or download.


# Browser Storage

## rx.Cookie

Represents a state Var that is stored as a cookie in the browser. Currently only supports string values.

Parameters

- `name` : The name of the cookie on the client side.
- `path`: The cookie path. Use `/` to make the cookie accessible on all pages.
- `max_age` : Relative max age of the cookie in seconds from when the client receives it.
- `domain`: Domain for the cookie (e.g., `sub.domain.com` or `.allsubdomains.com`).
- `secure`: If the cookie is only accessible through HTTPS.
- `same_site`: Whether the cookie is sent with third-party requests. Can be one of (`True`, `False`, `None`, `lax`, `strict`).

```python
class CookieState(rx.State):
    c1: str = rx.Cookie()
    c2: str = rx.Cookie('c2 default')

    # cookies with custom settings
    c3: str = rx.Cookie(max_age=2)  # expires after 2 second
    c4: str = rx.Cookie(same_site='strict')
    c5: str = rx.Cookie(path='/foo/')  # only accessible on `/foo/`
    c6: str = rx.Cookie(name='c6-custom-name')
```

```md alert warning
# **The default value of a Cookie is never set in the browser!**

The Cookie value is only set when the Var is assigned. If you need to set a
default value, you can assign a value to the cookie in an `on_load` event
handler.
```

## Accessing Cookies

Cookies are accessed like any other Var in the state. If another state needs access
to the value of a cookie, the state should be a substate of the state that defines
the cookie. Alternatively the `get_state` API can be used to access the other state.

For rendering cookies in the frontend, import the state that defines the cookie and
reference it directly.

```md alert warning
# **Two separate states should _avoid_ defining `rx.Cookie` with the same name.**

Although it is technically possible, the cookie options may differ, leading to
unexpected results.

Additionally, updating the cookie value in one state will not automatically
update the value in the other state without a page refresh or navigation event.
```

## rx.remove_cookies

Remove a cookie from the client's browser.

Parameters:

- `key`: The name of cookie to remove.

```python
rx.button(
    'Remove cookie', on_click=rx.remove_cookie('key')
)
```

This event can also be returned from an event handler:

```python
class CookieState(rx.State):
    ...
    def logout(self):
        return rx.remove_cookie('auth_token')
```

## rx.LocalStorage

Represents a state Var that is stored in localStorage in the browser. Currently only supports string values.

Parameters

- `name`: The name of the storage key on the client side.
- `sync`: Boolean indicates if the state should be kept in sync across tabs of the same browser.

```python
class LocalStorageState(rx.State):
    # local storage with default settings
    l1: str = rx.LocalStorage()

    # local storage with custom settings
    l2: str = rx.LocalStorage("l2 default")
    l3: str = rx.LocalStorage(name="l3")

    # local storage that automatically updates in other states across tabs
    l4: str = rx.LocalStorage(sync=True)
```

### Syncing Vars

Because LocalStorage applies to the entire browser, all LocalStorage Vars are
automatically shared across tabs.

The `sync` parameter controls whether an update in one tab should be actively
propagated to other tabs without requiring a navigation or page refresh event.

## rx.remove_local_storage

Remove a local storage item from the client's browser.

Parameters

- `key`: The key to remove from local storage.

```python
rx.button(
    'Remove Local Storage',
    on_click=rx.remove_local_storage('key'),
)
```

This event can also be returned from an event handler:

```python
class LocalStorageState(rx.State):
    ...
    def logout(self):
        return rx.remove_local_storage('local_storage_state.l1')
```

## rx.clear_local_storage()

Clear all local storage items from the client's browser. This may affect other
apps running in the same domain or libraries within your app that use local
storage.

```python
rx.button(
    'Clear all Local Storage',
    on_click=rx.clear_local_storage(),
)
```

## rx.SessionStorage

Represents a state Var that is stored in sessionStorage in the browser. Similar to localStorage, but the data is cleared when the page session ends (when the browser/tab is closed). Currently only supports string values.

Parameters

- `name`: The name of the storage key on the client side.

```python
class SessionStorageState(rx.State):
    # session storage with default settings
    s1: str = rx.SessionStorage()

    # session storage with custom settings
    s2: str = rx.SessionStorage("s2 default")
    s3: str = rx.SessionStorage(name="s3")
```

### Session Persistence

SessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the browser is open and survives page refreshes and restores, but is cleared when the tab or browser is closed.

Unlike LocalStorage, SessionStorage is isolated to the tab/window in which it was created, so it's not shared with other tabs/windows of the same origin.

## rx.remove_session_storage

Remove a session storage item from the client's browser.

Parameters

- `key`: The key to remove from session storage.

```python
rx.button(
    'Remove Session Storage',
    on_click=rx.remove_session_storage('key'),
)
```

This event can also be returned from an event handler:

```python
class SessionStorageState(rx.State):
    ...
    def logout(self):
        return rx.remove_session_storage('session_storage_state.s1')
```

## rx.clear_session_storage()

Clear all session storage items from the client's browser. This may affect other
apps running in the same domain or libraries within your app that use session
storage.

```python
rx.button(
    'Clear all Session Storage',
    on_click=rx.clear_session_storage(),
)
```

# Serialization Strategies

If a non-trivial data structure should be stored in a `Cookie`, `LocalStorage`, or `SessionStorage` var it needs to be serialized before and after storing it. It is recommended to use a pydantic class for the data which provides simple serialization helpers and works recursively in complex object structures.

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import pydantic


class AppSettings(pydantic.BaseModel):
    theme: str = 'light'
    sidebar_visible: bool = True
    update_frequency: int = 60
    error_messages: list[str] = pydantic.Field(default_factory=list)


class ComplexLocalStorageState(rx.State):
    data_raw: str = rx.LocalStorage("{}")
    data: AppSettings = AppSettings()
    settings_open: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def save_settings(self):
        self.data_raw = self.data.model_dump_json()
        self.settings_open = False

    @rx.event
    def open_settings(self):
        self.data = AppSettings.model_validate_json(self.data_raw)
        self.settings_open = True

    @rx.event
    def set_field(self, field, value):
        setattr(self.data, field, value)


def app_settings():
    return rx.form.root(
        rx.foreach(
            ComplexLocalStorageState.data.error_messages,
            rx.text,
        ),
        rx.form.field(
            rx.flex(
                rx.form.label(
                    "Theme",
                    rx.input(
                        value=ComplexLocalStorageState.data.theme,
                        on_change=lambda v: ComplexLocalStorageState.set_field(
                            "theme", v
                        ),
                    ),
                ),
                rx.form.label(
                    "Sidebar Visible",
                    rx.switch(
                        checked=ComplexLocalStorageState.data.sidebar_visible,
                        on_change=lambda v: ComplexLocalStorageState.set_field(
                            "sidebar_visible",
                            v,
                        ),
                    ),
                ),
                rx.form.label(
                    "Update Frequency (seconds)",
                    rx.input(
                        value=ComplexLocalStorageState.data.update_frequency,
                        on_change=lambda v: ComplexLocalStorageState.set_field(
                            "update_frequency",
                            v,
                        ),
                    ),
                ),
                rx.dialog.close(rx.button("Save", type="submit")),
                gap=2,
                direction="column",
            )
        ),
        on_submit=lambda _: ComplexLocalStorageState.save_settings(),
    )

def app_settings_example():
    return rx.dialog.root(
        rx.dialog.trigger(
            rx.button("App Settings", on_click=ComplexLocalStorageState.open_settings),
        ),
        rx.dialog.content(
            rx.dialog.title("App Settings"),
            app_settings(),
        ),
    )
```

# Comparison of Storage Types

Here's a comparison of the different client-side storage options in Reflex:

| Feature | rx.Cookie | rx.LocalStorage | rx.SessionStorage |
|---------|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Persistence | Until cookie expires | Until explicitly deleted | Until browser/tab is closed |
| Storage Limit | ~4KB | ~5MB | ~5MB |
| Sent with Requests | Yes | No | No |
| Accessibility | Server & Client | Client Only | Client Only |
| Expiration | Configurable | Never | End of session |
| Scope | Configurable (domain, path) | Origin (domain) | Tab/Window |
| Syncing Across Tabs | No | Yes (with sync=True) | No |
| Use Case | Authentication, Server-side state | User preferences, App state | Temporary session data |

# When to Use Each Storage Type

## Use rx.Cookie When:
- You need the data to be accessible on the server side (cookies are sent with HTTP requests)
- You're handling user authentication
- You need fine-grained control over expiration and scope
- You need to limit the data to specific paths in your app

## Use rx.LocalStorage When:
- You need to store larger amounts of data (up to ~5MB)
- You want the data to persist indefinitely (until explicitly deleted)
- You need to share data between different tabs/windows of your app
- You want to store user preferences that should be remembered across browser sessions

## Use rx.SessionStorage When:
- You need temporary data that should be cleared when the browser/tab is closed
- You want to isolate data to a specific tab/window
- You're storing sensitive information that shouldn't persist after the session ends
- You're implementing per-session features like form data, shopping carts, or multi-step processes
- You want to persist data for a state after Redis expiration (for server-side state that needs to survive longer than Redis TTL)


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import advanced_onboarding
```

# Plugins

Reflex supports a plugin system that allows you to extend the framework's functionality during the compilation process. Plugins can add frontend dependencies, modify build configurations, generate static assets, and perform custom tasks before compilation.

## Configuring Plugins

Plugins are configured in your `rxconfig.py` file using the `plugins` parameter:

```python
import reflex as rx

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="my_app",
    plugins=[
        rx.plugins.SitemapPlugin(),
        rx.plugins.TailwindV4Plugin(),
    ],
)
```

## Built-in Plugins

Reflex comes with several built-in plugins that provide common functionality.

### SitemapPlugin

The `SitemapPlugin` automatically generates a sitemap.xml file for your application, which helps search engines discover and index your pages.

```python
import reflex as rx

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="my_app",
    plugins=[
        rx.plugins.SitemapPlugin(),
    ],
)
```

The sitemap plugin automatically includes all your app's routes. For dynamic routes or custom configuration, you can add sitemap metadata to individual pages:

```python
@rx.page(route="/blog/[slug]", context={"sitemap": {"changefreq": "weekly", "priority": 0.8}})
def blog_post():
    return rx.text("Blog post content")

@rx.page(route="/about", context={"sitemap": {"changefreq": "monthly", "priority": 0.5}})
def about():
    return rx.text("About page")
```

The sitemap configuration supports the following options:
- `loc`: Custom URL for the page (required for dynamic routes)
- `lastmod`: Last modification date (datetime object)
- `changefreq`: How frequently the page changes (`"always"`, `"hourly"`, `"daily"`, `"weekly"`, `"monthly"`, `"yearly"`, `"never"`)
- `priority`: Priority of this URL relative to other URLs (0.0 to 1.0)

### TailwindV4Plugin

The `TailwindV4Plugin` provides support for Tailwind CSS v4, which is the recommended version for new projects and includes performance improvements and new features.

```python
import reflex as rx

# Basic configuration
config = rx.Config(
    app_name="my_app",
    plugins=[
        rx.plugins.TailwindV4Plugin(),
    ],
)
```

You can customize the Tailwind configuration by passing a config dictionary:

```python
import reflex as rx

tailwind_config = {
    "theme": {
        "extend": {
            "colors": {
                "brand": {
                    "50": "#eff6ff",
                    "500": "#3b82f6",
                    "900": "#1e3a8a",
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "plugins": ["@tailwindcss/typography"],
}

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="my_app",
    plugins=[
        rx.plugins.TailwindV4Plugin(tailwind_config),
    ],
)
```

### TailwindV3Plugin

The `TailwindV3Plugin` integrates Tailwind CSS v3 into your Reflex application. While still supported, TailwindV4Plugin is recommended for new projects.

```python
import reflex as rx

# Basic configuration
config = rx.Config(
    app_name="my_app",
    plugins=[
        rx.plugins.TailwindV3Plugin(),
    ],
)
```

You can customize the Tailwind configuration by passing a config dictionary:

```python
import reflex as rx

tailwind_config = {
    "theme": {
        "extend": {
            "colors": {
                "primary": "#3b82f6",
                "secondary": "#64748b",
            }
        }
    },
    "plugins": ["@tailwindcss/typography", "@tailwindcss/forms"],
}

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="my_app",
    plugins=[
        rx.plugins.TailwindV3Plugin(tailwind_config),
    ],
)
```

## Plugin Management

### Default Plugins

Some plugins are enabled by default. Currently, the `SitemapPlugin` is enabled automatically. If you want to disable a default plugin, use the `disable_plugins` parameter:

```python
import reflex as rx

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="my_app",
    disable_plugins=["reflex.plugins.sitemap.SitemapPlugin"],
)
```

### Plugin Order

Plugins are executed in the order they appear in the `plugins` list. This can be important if plugins have dependencies on each other or modify the same files.

```python
import reflex as rx

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="my_app",
    plugins=[
        rx.plugins.TailwindV4Plugin(),  # Runs first
        rx.plugins.SitemapPlugin(),     # Runs second
    ],
)
```


## Plugin Architecture

All plugins inherit from the base `Plugin` class and can implement several lifecycle methods:

```python
class Plugin:
    def get_frontend_development_dependencies(self, **context) -> list[str]:
        """Get NPM packages required by the plugin for development."""
        return []
    
    def get_frontend_dependencies(self, **context) -> list[str]:
        """Get NPM packages required by the plugin."""
        return []
    
    def get_static_assets(self, **context) -> Sequence[tuple[Path, str | bytes]]:
        """Get static assets required by the plugin."""
        return []
    
    def get_stylesheet_paths(self, **context) -> Sequence[str]:
        """Get paths to stylesheets required by the plugin."""
        return []
    
    def pre_compile(self, **context) -> None:
        """Called before compilation to perform custom tasks."""
        pass
```

### Creating Custom Plugins

You can create custom plugins by inheriting from the base `Plugin` class:

```python
from reflex.plugins.base import Plugin
from pathlib import Path

class CustomPlugin(Plugin):
    def get_frontend_dependencies(self, **context):
        return ["my-custom-package@1.0.0"]
    
    def pre_compile(self, **context):
        # Custom logic before compilation
        print("Running custom plugin logic...")
        
        # Add a custom task
        context["add_save_task"](self.create_custom_file)
    
    def create_custom_file(self):
        return "public/custom.txt", "Custom content"
```

Then use it in your configuration:

```python
import reflex as rx
from my_plugins import CustomPlugin

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="my_app",
    plugins=[
        CustomPlugin(),
    ],
)
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Special Events

Reflex includes a set of built-in special events that can be utilized as event triggers
or returned from event handlers in your applications. These events enhance interactivity and user experience.
Below are the special events available in Reflex, along with explanations of their functionality:

## rx.console_log

Perform a console.log in the browser's console.

```python demo
rx.button('Log', on_click=rx.console_log('Hello World!'))
```

When triggered, this event logs a specified message to the browser's developer console.
It's useful for debugging and monitoring the behavior of your application.

## rx.scroll_to

scroll to an element in the page

```python demo
rx.button(
    "Scroll to download button",
    on_click=rx.scroll_to("download button")

)
```

When this is triggered, it scrolls to an element passed by id as parameter. Click on button to scroll to download button (rx.download section) at the bottom of the page

## rx.redirect

Redirect the user to a new path within the application.

### Parameters

- `path`: The destination path or URL to which the user should be redirected.
- `external`: If set to True, the redirection will open in a new tab. Defaults to `False`.

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.button("open in tab", on_click=rx.redirect("/docs/api-reference/special-events")),
    rx.button("open in new tab", on_click=rx.redirect('https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex/', is_external=True))
)
```

When this event is triggered, it navigates the user to a different page or location within your Reflex application.
By default, the redirection occurs in the same tab. However, if you set the external parameter to True, the redirection
will open in a new tab or window, providing a seamless user experience.

This event can also be run from an event handler in State. It is necessary to `return` the `rx.redirect()`.

```python demo exec
class RedirectExampleState(rx.State):
    """The app state."""

    @rx.event
    def change_page(self):
        return rx.redirect('https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex/', is_external=True)

def redirect_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.button("Change page in State", on_click=RedirectExampleState.change_page),
    )
```

## rx.set_clipboard

Set the specified text content to the clipboard.

```python demo
rx.button('Copy "Hello World" to clipboard',on_click=rx.set_clipboard('Hello World'),)
```

This event allows you to copy a given text or content to the user's clipboard.
It's handy when you want to provide a "Copy to Clipboard" feature in your application,
allowing users to easily copy information to paste elsewhere.

## rx.set_value

Set the value of a specified reference element.

```python demo
rx.hstack(
    rx.input(id='input1'),
    rx.button(
        'Erase', on_click=rx.set_value('input1', '')
    ),
)
```

With this event, you can modify the value of a particular HTML element, typically an input field or another form element.

## rx.window_alert

Create a window alert in the browser.

```python demo
rx.button('Alert', on_click=rx.window_alert('Hello World!'))
```

## rx.download

Download a file at a given path.

Parameters:

- `url`: The URL of the file to be downloaded.
- `data`: The data to be downloaded. Should be `str` or `bytes`, `data:` URI, `PIL.Image`, or any state Var (to be converted to JSON).
- `filename`: The desired filename of the downloaded file.

```md alert
# `url` and `data` args are mutually exclusive, and at least one of them must be provided.
```

```python demo
rx.button("Download", on_click=rx.download(url="/reflex_banner.png", filename="different_name_logo.png"), id="download button")
```

The `reflex init` command creates a new Reflex app in the current directory.
If an `rxconfig.py` file already exists already, it will re-initialize the app with the latest template.

```bash
$ reflex init --help
Usage: reflex init [OPTIONS]

  Initialize a new Reflex app in the current directory.

Options:
  --name APP_NAME                 The name of the app to initialize.
  --template [demo|sidebar|blank]
                                  The template to initialize the app with.

  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

## Run

The `reflex run` command runs the app in the current directory.

By default it runs your app in development mode.
This means that the app will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.
You can also run in production mode which will create an optimized build of your app.

You can configure the mode, as well as other options through flags.

```bash
$ reflex run --help
Usage: reflex run [OPTIONS]

  Run the app in the current directory.

Options:
  --env [dev|prod]                The environment to run the app in.
                                  [default: Env.DEV]
  --frontend-only                 Execute only frontend.
  --backend-only                  Execute only backend.
  --frontend-port TEXT            Specify a different frontend port.

                                  The log level to use.  [default:
                                  LogLevel.INFO]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

## Export

You can export your app's frontend and backend to zip files using the `reflex export` command.

The frontend is a compiled NextJS app, which can be deployed to a static hosting service like Github Pages or Vercel.
However this is just a static build, so you will need to deploy the backend separately.
See the self-hosting guide for more information.

## Rename

The `reflex rename` command allows you to rename your Reflex app. This updates the app name in the configuration files.

```bash
$ reflex rename --help
Usage: reflex rename [OPTIONS] NEW_NAME

  Rename the app in the current directory.

# Browser Javascript

Reflex compiles your frontend code, defined as python functions, into a Javascript web application
that runs in the user's browser. There are instances where you may need to supply custom javascript
code to interop with Web APIs, use certain third-party libraries, or wrap low-level functionality
that is not exposed via Reflex's Python API.

```md alert
# Avoid Custom Javascript

Custom Javascript code in your Reflex app presents a maintenance challenge, as it will be harder to debug and may be unstable across Reflex versions.

Prefer to use the Python API whenever possible and file an issue if you need additional functionality that is not currently provided.
```

## Executing Script

There are four ways to execute custom Javascript code into your Reflex app:

- `rx.script` - Injects the script via `next/script` for efficient loading of inline and external Javascript code. Described further in the [component library]({library.other.script.path}).
  - These components can be directly included in the body of a page, or they may
    be passed to `rx.App(head_components=[rx.script(...)])` to be included in
    the `<Head>` tag of all pages.
- `rx.call_script` - An event handler that evaluates arbitrary Javascript code,
  and optionally returns the result to another event handler.

These previous two methods can work in tandem to load external scripts and then
call functions defined within them in response to user events.

The following two methods are geared towards wrapping components and are
described with examples in the [Wrapping React]({wrapping_react.overview.path})
section.

- `_get_hooks` and `_get_custom_code` in an `rx.Component` subclass
- `Var.create` with `_var_is_local=False`

## Inline Scripts

The `rx.script` component is the recommended way to load inline Javascript for greater control over
frontend behavior.

The functions and variables in the script can be accessed from backend event
handlers or frontend event triggers via the `rx.call_script` interface.

```python demo exec
class SoundEffectState(rx.State):
    @rx.event(background=True)
    async def delayed_play(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        return rx.call_script("playFromStart(button_sfx)")


def sound_effect_demo():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.script("""
            var button_sfx = new Audio("/vintage-button-sound-effect.mp3")
            function playFromStart (sfx) {sfx.load(); sfx.play()}"""),
        rx.button("Play Immediately", on_click=rx.call_script("playFromStart(button_sfx)")),
        rx.button("Play Later", on_click=SoundEffectState.delayed_play),
    )
```

## External Scripts

External scripts can be loaded either from the `assets` directory, or from CDN URL, and then controlled
via `rx.call_script`.

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.script(
        src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/scottschiller/snowstorm@snowstorm_20131208/snowstorm-min.js",
    ),
    rx.script("""
        window.addEventListener('load', function() {
            if (typeof snowStorm !== 'undefined') {
                snowStorm.autoStart = false;
                snowStorm.snowColor = '#111';
            }
        });
    """),
    rx.button("Start Duststorm", on_click=rx.call_script("snowStorm.start()")),
    rx.button("Toggle Duststorm", on_click=rx.call_script("snowStorm.toggleSnow()")),
)
```

## Accessing Client Side Values

The `rx.call_script` function accepts a `callback` parameter that expects an
Event Handler with one argument which will receive the result of evaluating the
Javascript code. This can be used to access client-side values such as the
`window.location` or current scroll location, or any previously defined value.

```python demo exec
class WindowState(rx.State):
    location: dict[str, str] = {}
    scroll_position: dict[str, int] = {}

    def update_location(self, location):
        self.location = location

    def update_scroll_position(self, scroll_position):
        self.scroll_position = {
            "x": scroll_position[0],
            "y": scroll_position[1],
        }

    @rx.event
    def get_client_values(self):
        return [
            rx.call_script(
                "window.location",
                callback=WindowState.update_location
            ),
            rx.call_script(
                "[window.scrollX, window.scrollY]",
                callback=WindowState.update_scroll_position,
            ),
        ]


def window_state_demo():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.button("Update Values", on_click=WindowState.get_client_values),
        rx.text(f"Scroll Position: {WindowState.scroll_position.to_string()}"),
        rx.text("window.location:"),
        rx.text_area(value=WindowState.location.to_string(), is_read_only=True),
        on_mount=WindowState.get_client_values,
    )
```

```md alert
# Allowed Callback Values

The `callback` parameter may be an `EventHandler` with one argument, or a lambda with one argument that returns an `EventHandler`.
If the callback is None, then no event is triggered.
```

## Using React Hooks

To use React Hooks directly in a Reflex app, you must subclass `rx.Component`,
typically `rx.Fragment` is used when the hook functionality has no visual
element. The hook code is returned by the `add_hooks` method, which is expected
to return a `list[str]` containing Javascript code which will be inserted into the
page component (i.e the render function itself).

For supporting code that must be defined outside of the component render
function, use `_get_custom_code`.

The following example uses `useEffect` to register global hotkeys on the
`document` object, and then triggers an event when a specific key is pressed.

```python demo exec
import dataclasses

from reflex.utils import imports

@dataclasses.dataclass
class KeyEvent:
    """Interface of Javascript KeyboardEvent"""
    key: str = ""

def key_event_spec(ev: rx.Var[KeyEvent]) -> tuple[rx.Var[str]]:
    # Takes the event object and returns the key pressed to send to the state
    return (ev.key,)

class GlobalHotkeyState(rx.State):
    key: str = ""

    @rx.event
    def update_key(self, key):
        self.key = key


class GlobalHotkeyWatcher(rx.Fragment):
    """A component that listens for key events globally."""

    # The event handler that will be called
    on_key_down: rx.EventHandler[key_event_spec]

    def add_imports(self) -> imports.ImportDict:
        """Add the imports for the component."""
        return {
            "react": [imports.ImportVar(tag="useEffect")],
        }

    def add_hooks(self) -> list[str | rx.Var]:
        """Add the hooks for the component."""
        return [
            """
            useEffect(() => {
                const handle_key = %s;
                document.addEventListener("keydown", handle_key, false);
                return () => {
                    document.removeEventListener("keydown", handle_key, false);
                }
            })
            """
            % str(rx.Var.create(self.event_triggers["on_key_down"]))
        ]

def global_key_demo():
    return rx.vstack(
        GlobalHotkeyWatcher.create(
            keys=["a", "s", "d", "w"],
            on_key_down=lambda key: rx.cond(
                rx.Var.create(["a", "s", "d", "w"]).contains(key),
                GlobalHotkeyState.update_key(key),
                rx.console_log(key)
            )
        ),
        rx.text("Press a, s, d or w to trigger an event"),
        rx.heading(f"Last watched key pressed: {GlobalHotkeyState.key}"),
    )
```

# Utility Functions

Reflex provides utility functions to help with common tasks in your applications.

## run_in_thread

The `run_in_thread` function allows you to run a **non-async** function in a separate thread, which is useful for preventing long-running operations from blocking the UI event queue.

```python
async def run_in_thread(func: Callable) -> Any
```

### Parameters

- `func`: The non-async function to run in a separate thread.

### Returns

- The return value of the function.

### Raises

- `ValueError`: If the function is an async function.

### Usage

```python demo exec id=run_in_thread_demo
import asyncio
import dataclasses
import time
import reflex as rx


def quick_blocking_function():
    time.sleep(0.5)
    return "Quick task completed successfully!"

            self.tasks.append(TaskInfo(status="Running quick task..."))
            task_info = self.tasks[task_ix]
        
        try:
            result = await rx.run_in_thread(quick_blocking_function)
            async with self:

                timeout=1.0,
            )
            async with self:

        ),
        width="100%",
        align_items="start",
        spacing="4",
    )
```

### When to Use run_in_thread

Use `run_in_thread` when you need to:

1. Execute CPU-bound operations that would otherwise block the event loop
2. Call synchronous libraries that don't have async equivalents
3. Prevent long-running operations from blocking UI responsiveness

### Example: Processing a Large File

```python
import reflex as rx
import time

class FileProcessingState(rx.State):
    progress: str = "Ready"
    
    @rx.event(background=True)
    async def process_large_file(self):
        async with self:
            self.progress = "Processing file..."
        
        def process_file():
            # Simulate processing a large file
            time.sleep(5)
            return "File processed successfully!"
        
        # Save the result to a local variable to avoid blocking the event loop.
        result = await rx.run_in_thread(process_file)
        async with self:
            # Then assign the local result to the state while holding the lock.
            self.progress = result
```

# Event Triggers

Components can modify the state based on user events such as clicking a button or entering text in a field.
These events are triggered by event triggers.

Event triggers are component specific and are listed in the documentation for each component.

## Component Lifecycle Events

Reflex components have lifecycle events like `on_mount` and `on_unmount` that allow you to execute code at specific points in a component's existence. These events are crucial for initializing data, cleaning up resources, and creating dynamic user interfaces.

### When Lifecycle Events Are Activated

- **on_mount**: This event is triggered immediately after a component is rendered and attached to the DOM. It fires:
  - When a page containing the component is first loaded
  - When a component is conditionally rendered (appears after being hidden)
  - When navigating to a page containing the component using internal navigation
  - It does NOT fire when the page is refreshed or when following external links

- **on_unmount**: This event is triggered just before a component is removed from the DOM. It fires:
  - When navigating away from a page containing the component using internal navigation
  - When a component is conditionally removed from the DOM (e.g., via a condition that hides it)
  - It does NOT fire when refreshing the page, closing the browser tab, or following external links

## Page Load Events

In addition to component lifecycle events, Reflex also provides page-level events like `on_load` that are triggered when a page loads. The `on_load` event is useful for:

- Fetching data when a page first loads
- Checking authentication status
- Initializing page-specific state
- Setting default values for cookies or browser storage

You can specify an event handler to run when the page loads using the `on_load` parameter in the `@rx.page` decorator or `app.add_page()` method:

```python
class State(rx.State):
    data: dict = dict()

    @rx.event
    def get_data(self):
        # Fetch data when the page loads
        self.data = fetch_data()

@rx.page(on_load=State.get_data)
def index():
    return rx.text('Data loaded on page load')
```

This is particularly useful for authentication checks:

```python
class State(rx.State):
    authenticated: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def check_auth(self):
        # Check if user is authenticated
        self.authenticated = check_auth()
        if not self.authenticated:
            return rx.redirect('/login')

@rx.page(on_load=State.check_auth)
def protected_page():
    return rx.text('Protected content')
```

For more details on page load events, see the [page load events documentation]({events.page_load_events.path}).

# Event Reference

```python eval
rx.box(
    rx.divider(),
    component_grid(),
)
```


# Reflex's Var System

## Motivation

Reflex supports some basic operations in state variables on the frontend.
Reflex automatically converts variable operations from Python into a JavaScript equivalent.

Here's an example of a Reflex conditional in Python that returns "Pass" if the threshold is equal to or greater than 50 and "Fail" otherwise:

```py
rx.cond(
    State.threshold >= 50,
    "Pass",
    "Fail",
)
```

 The conditional to roughly the following in Javascript:

```js
state.threshold >= 50 ? "Pass" : "Fail";
```

## Overview

Simply put, a `Var` in Reflex represents a Javascript expression.
If the type is known, it can be any of the following:

- `NumberVar` represents an expression that evaluates to a Javascript `number`. `NumberVar` can support both integers and floating point values
- `BooleanVar` represents a boolean expression. For example: `false`, `3 > 2`.
- `StringVar` represents an expression that evaluates to a string. For example: `'hello'`, `(2).toString()`.
- `ArrayVar` represents an expression that evaluates to an array object. For example: `[1, 2, 3]`, `'words'.split()`.
- `ObjectVar` represents an expression that evaluates to an object. For example: `\{a: 2, b: 3}`, `\{deeply: \{nested: \{value: false}}}`.
- `NoneVar` represent null values. These can be either `undefined` or `null`.

## Creating Vars

State fields are converted to `Var` by default. Additionally, you can create a `Var` from Python values using `rx.Var.create()`:

```py
rx.Var.create(4) # NumberVar
rx.Var.create("hello") # StringVar
rx.Var.create([1, 2, 3]) # ArrayVar
```

If you want to explicitly create a `Var` from a raw Javascript string, you can instantiate `rx.Var` directly:

```py
rx.Var("2", _var_type=int).guess_type() # NumberVar
```

In the example above, `.guess_type()` will attempt to downcast from a generic `Var` type into `NumberVar`.
For this example, calling the function `.to(int)` can also be used in place of `.guess_type()`.

## Operations

The `Var` system also supports some other basic operations.
For example, `NumberVar` supports basic arithmetic operations like `+` and `-`, as in Python.
It also supports comparisons that return a `BooleanVar`.

Custom `Var` operations can also be defined:

```py
from reflex.vars import var_operation, var_operation_return, ArrayVar, NumberVar

@var_operation
def multiply_array_values(a: ArrayVar):
    return var_operation_return(
        js_expression=f"\{a}.reduce((p, c) => p * c, 1)",
        var_type=int,
    )

def factorial(value: NumberVar):
    return rx.cond(
        value <= 1,
        1,
        multiply_array_values(rx.Var.range(1, value+1))
    )
```

Use `js_expression` to pass explicit JavaScript expressions; in the `multiply_array_values` example, we pass in a JavaScript expression that calculates the product of all elements in an array called `a` by using the reduce method to multiply each element with the accumulated result, starting from an initial value of 1.
Later, we leverage `rx.cond` in the' factorial' function, we instantiate an array using the `range` function, and pass this array to `multiply_array_values`.


```python exec
from pcweb.pages.docs import components
from pcweb.pages.docs.library import library
import reflex as rx
```

# UI Overview

Components are the building blocks for your app's user interface (UI). They are the visual elements that make up your app, like buttons, text, and images.

## Component Basics

Components are made up of children and props.

```md definition
# Children
* Text or other Reflex components nested inside a component.
* Passed as **positional arguments**.

# Props
* Attributes that affect the behavior and appearance of a component.
* Passed as **keyword arguments**.
```

Let's take a look at the `rx.text` component.

```python demo
rx.text('Hello World!', color='blue', font_size="1.5em")
```

Here `"Hello World!"` is the child text to display, while `color` and `font_size` are props that modify the appearance of the text.

```md alert success
# Regular Python data types can be passed in as children to components. This is useful for passing in text, numbers, and other simple data types.
```

## Another Example

Now let's take a look at a more complex component, which has other components nested inside it. The `rx.vstack` component is a container that arranges its children vertically with space between them.

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.heading("Sample Form"),
    rx.input(placeholder="Name"),
    rx.checkbox("Subscribe to Newsletter"),
)
```

Some props are specific to a component. For example, the `header` and `content` props of the `rx.accordion.item` component show the heading and accordion content details of the accordion respectively.

Styling props like `color` are shared across many components.

```md alert info
# You can find all the props for a component by checking its documentation page in the [component library]({library.path}).
```

## Pages

Reflex apps are organized into pages, each of which maps to a different URL.

Pages are defined as functions that return a component. By default, the function name will be used as the path, but you can also specify a route explicitly.

```python
def index():
    return rx.text('Root Page')


def about():
    return rx.text('About Page')


app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index, route="/")
app.add_page(about, route="/about")
```

In this example we add a page called `index` at the root route.
If you `reflex run` the app, you will see the `index` page at `http://localhost:3000`.
Similarly, the `about` page will be available at `http://localhost:3000/about`.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import assets
```

# Custom Stylesheets

Reflex allows you to add custom stylesheets. Simply pass the URLs of the stylesheets to `rx.App`:

```python
app = rx.App(
    stylesheets=[
        "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css",
    ],
)
```

## Local Stylesheets

You can also add local stylesheets. Just put the stylesheet under [`assets/`]({assets.upload_and_download_files.path}) and pass the path to the stylesheet to `rx.App`:

```python
app = rx.App(
    stylesheets=[
        "/styles.css",  # This path is relative to assets/
    ],
)
```

```md alert warning
# Always use a leading slash (/) when referencing files in the assets directory.
Without a leading slash the path is considered relative to the current page route and may
not work for routes containing more than one path component, like `/blog/my-cool-post`.
```


## Styling with CSS

You can use CSS variables directly in your Reflex app by passing them alongside the appropriae props. Create a `style.css` file inside the `assets` folder with the following lines:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: blue;
    --accent-color: green;
}
```

Then, after referencing the CSS file within the `stylesheets` props of `rx.App`, you can access the CSS props directly like this

```python
app = rx.App(
    theme=rx.theme(appearance="light"),
    stylesheets=["/style.css"],
)
app.add_page(
    rx.center(
        rx.text("CSS Variables!"),
        width="100%",
        height="100vh",
        bg="var(--primary-color)",
    ),
    "/",
)
```

## SASS/SCSS Support

Reflex supports SASS/SCSS stylesheets alongside regular CSS. This allows you to use more advanced styling features like variables, nesting, mixins, and more.

### Using SASS/SCSS Files

To use SASS/SCSS files in your Reflex app:

1. Create a `.sass` or `.scss` file in your `assets` directory
2. Reference the file in your `rx.App` configuration just like you would with CSS files

```python
app = rx.App(
    stylesheets=[
        "/styles.scss",  # This path is relative to assets/
        "/sass/main.sass",  # You can organize files in subdirectories
    ],
)
```

Reflex automatically detects the file extension and compiles these files to CSS using the `libsass` package.

### Example SASS/SCSS File

Here's an example of a SASS file (`assets/styles.scss`) that demonstrates some of the features:

```scss
// Variables
$primary-color: #3498db;
$secondary-color: #2ecc71;
$padding: 16px;

// Nesting
.container {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  padding: $padding;
  
  .button {
    background-color: $secondary-color;
    padding: $padding / 2;
    
    &:hover {
      opacity: 0.8;
    }
  }
}

// Mixins
@mixin flex-center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.centered-box {
  @include flex-center;
  height: 100px;
}
```

### Dependency Requirement

The `libsass` package is required for SASS/SCSS compilation. If it's not installed, Reflex will show an error message. You can install it with:

```bash
pip install "libsass>=0.23.0"
```

This package is included in the default Reflex installation, so you typically don't need to install it separately.

## Fonts

You can take advantage of Reflex's support for custom stylesheets to add custom fonts to your app.

In this example, we will use the [JetBrains Mono]({"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono"}) font from Google Fonts. First, add the stylesheet with the font to your app. You can get this link from the "Get embed code" section of the Google font page.

```python
app = rx.App(
    stylesheets=[
        "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=JetBrains+Mono:ital,wght@0,100;0,200;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;0,700;1,100;1,200;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,600;1,700&display=swap",
    ],
)
```

Then you can use the font in your component by setting the `font_family` prop.

```python demo
rx.text(
    "Check out my font",
    font_family="JetBrains Mono",
    font_size="1.5em",
)
```

## Local Fonts

By making use of the two previous points, we can also make a stylesheet that allow you to use a font hosted on your server.

If your font is called `MyFont.otf`, copy it in `assets/fonts`.

Now we have the font ready, let's create the stylesheet `myfont.css`.

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: MyFont;
    src: url("/fonts/MyFont.otf") format("opentype");
}

@font-face {
    font-family: MyFont;
    font-weight: bold;
    src: url("/fonts/MyFont.otf") format("opentype");
}
```

Add the reference to your new Stylesheet in your App.

```python
app = rx.App(
    stylesheets=[
        "/fonts/myfont.css",  # This path is relative to assets/
    ],
)
```

And that's it! You can now use `MyFont` like any other FontFamily to style your components.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import library

```

# Tailwind

Reflex supports [Tailwind CSS]({"https://tailwindcss.com/"}) through a plugin system that provides better control and supports multiple Tailwind versions.

## Plugin-Based Configuration

The recommended way to use Tailwind CSS is through the plugin system:

```python
import reflex as rx

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="myapp",
    plugins=[
        rx.plugins.TailwindV4Plugin(),
    ],
)
```

You can customize the Tailwind configuration by passing a config dictionary to the plugin:

```python
import reflex as rx

tailwind_config = {
    "plugins": ["@tailwindcss/typography"],
    "theme": {
        "extend": {
            "colors": {
                "primary": "#3b82f6",
                "secondary": "#64748b",
            }
        }
    },
}

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="myapp",
    plugins=[
        rx.plugins.TailwindV4Plugin(tailwind_config),
    ],
)
```

```md alert info
## Migration from Legacy Configuration

If you're currently using the legacy `tailwind` configuration parameter, you should migrate to using the plugin system:

**Old approach (legacy):**
``````python
config = rx.Config(
    app_name="my_app",
    tailwind={
        "plugins": ["@tailwindcss/typography"],
        "theme": {"extend": {"colors": {"primary": "#3b82f6"}}},
    },
)
``````

**New approach (plugin-based):**
``````python
tailwind_config = {
    "plugins": ["@tailwindcss/typography"],
    "theme": {"extend": {"colors": {"primary": "#3b82f6"}}},
}

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="my_app",
    plugins=[
        rx.plugins.TailwindV4Plugin(tailwind_config),
    ],
)
``````
```

### Choosing Between Tailwind Versions

Reflex supports both Tailwind CSS v3 and v4:

- **TailwindV4Plugin**: The recommended choice for new projects. Includes the latest features and performance improvements and is used by default in new Reflex templates.
- **TailwindV3Plugin**: Still supported for existing projects. Use this if you need compatibility with older Tailwind configurations.

```python
# For Tailwind CSS v4 (recommended for new projects)
config = rx.Config(
    app_name="myapp", 
    plugins=[rx.plugins.TailwindV4Plugin()],
)

# For Tailwind CSS v3 (existing projects)
config = rx.Config(
    app_name="myapp",
    plugins=[rx.plugins.TailwindV3Plugin()],
)
```

All Tailwind configuration options are supported.

You can use any of the [utility classes]({"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first"}) under the `class_name` prop:

```python demo
rx.box(
    "Hello World",
    class_name="text-4xl text-center text-blue-500",
)
```

## Disabling Tailwind

To disable Tailwind in your project, simply don't include any Tailwind plugins in your configuration. This will prevent Tailwind styles from being applied to your application.

## Custom theme

You can integrate custom Tailwind themes within your Reflex app as well. The setup process is similar to the CSS Styling method mentioned above, with only a few minor variations.

Begin by creating a CSS file inside your `assets` folder. Inside the CSS file, include the following Tailwind directives:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

:root {
  --background: blue;
  --foreground: green;
}

.dark {
  --background: darkblue;
  --foreground: lightgreen;
}
```

We define a couple of custom CSS variables (`--background` and `--foreground`) that will be used throughout your app for styling. These variables can be dynamically updated based on the theme.

Tailwind defaults to light mode, but to handle dark mode, you can define a separate set of CSS variables under the `.dark` class. 

Tailwind Directives (`@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components`, `@tailwind utilities`): These are essential Tailwind CSS imports that enable the default base styles, components, and utility classes.

Next, you'll need to configure Tailwind in your `rxconfig.py` file to ensure that the Reflex app uses your custom Tailwind setup.

```python
import reflex as rx

tailwind_config = {
    "plugins": ["@tailwindcss/typography"],
    "theme": {
        "extend": {
            "colors": {
                "background": "var(--background)",
                "foreground": "var(--foreground)"
            },
        }
    },
}

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="app",
    plugins=[
        rx.plugins.TailwindV4Plugin(tailwind_config),
    ],
)
```

In the theme section, we're extending the default Tailwind theme to include custom colors. Specifically, we're referencing the CSS variables (`--background` and `--foreground`) that were defined earlier in your CSS file.

The `rx.Config` object is used to initialize and configure your Reflex app. Here, we're passing the `tailwind_config` dictionary to ensure Tailwind's custom setup is applied to the app.

Finally, to apply your custom styles and Tailwind configuration, you need to reference the CSS file you created in your `assets` folder inside the `rx.App` setup. This will allow you to use the custom properties (variables) directly within your Tailwind classes.

In your `app.py` (or main application file), make the following changes:

```python
app = rx.App(
    theme=rx.theme(appearance="light"),
    stylesheets=["/style.css"],
)
app.add_page(
    rx.center(
        rx.text("Tailwind & Reflex!"),
        class_name="bg-background w-full h-[100vh]",
    ),
    "/",
)
```

The `bg-background` class uses the `--background` variable (defined in the CSS file), which will be applied as the background color.

## Dynamic Styling

You can style a component based of a condition using `rx.cond` or `rx.match`.

```python demo exec
class TailwindState(rx.State):
    active = False

    @rx.event
    def toggle_active(self):
        self.active = not self.active

def tailwind_demo():
    return rx.el.div(
        rx.el.button(
            "Click me",
            on_click=TailwindState.toggle_active,
            class_name=(
                "px-4 py-2 text-white rounded-md",
                rx.cond(
                    TailwindState.active,
                    "bg-red-500",
                    "bg-blue-500",
                ),
            ),
        ),
    )
```

## Using Tailwind Classes from the State

When using Tailwind with Reflex, it's important to understand that class names must be statically defined in your code for Tailwind to properly compile them. If you dynamically generate class names from state variables or functions at runtime, Tailwind won't be able to detect these classes during the build process, resulting in missing styles in your application.

For example, this won't work correctly because the class names are defined in the state:

```python demo exec
class TailwindState(rx.State):
    active = False

    @rx.var
    def button_class(self) -> str:
        return "bg-accent" if self.active else "bg-secondary"

    @rx.event
    def toggle_active(self):
        self.active = not self.active

def tailwind_demo():
    return rx.el.button(
        f"Click me: {TailwindState.active}",
        class_name=TailwindState.button_class,
        on_click=TailwindState.toggle_active,
    )
```

## Using Tailwind with Reflex Core Components

Reflex core components are built on Radix Themes, which means they come with pre-defined styling. When you apply Tailwind classes to these components, you may encounter styling conflicts or unexpected behavior as the Tailwind styles compete with the built-in Radix styles.

For the best experience when using Tailwind CSS in your Reflex application, we recommend using the lower-level `rx.el` components. These components don't have pre-applied styles, giving you complete control over styling with Tailwind classes without any conflicts. Check the list of HTML components [here]({library.other.html.path}).



```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.styles.styles import get_code_style, cell_style
```

# Responsive

Reflex apps can be made responsive to look good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

You can pass a list of values to any style property to specify its value on different screen sizes.

```python demo
rx.text(
    "Hello World",
    color=["orange", "red", "purple", "blue", "green"],
)
```

The text will change color based on your screen size. If you are on desktop, try changing the size of your browser window to see the color change.

_New in 0.5.6_

Responsive values can also be specified using `rx.breakpoints`. Each size maps to a corresponding key, the value of which will be applied when the screen size is greater than or equal to the named breakpoint.

```python demo
rx.text(
    "Hello World",
    color=rx.breakpoints(
        initial="orange",
        sm="purple",
        lg="green",
    ),
)
```

Custom breakpoints in CSS units can be mapped to values per component using a dictionary instead of named parameters.

```python
rx.text(
    "Hello World",
    color=rx.breakpoints({
        "0px": "orange",
        "48em": "purple",
        "80em": "green",
    }),
)
```

For the Radix UI components' fields that supports responsive value, you can also use `rx.breakpoints` (note that custom breakpoints and list syntax aren't supported).

```python demo
rx.grid(
    rx.foreach(
        list(range(6)),
        lambda _: rx.box(bg_color="#a7db76", height="100px", width="100px")
    ),
    columns=rx.breakpoints(
        initial="2",
        sm="4",
        lg="6"
    ),
    spacing="4"
)
```

## Setting Defaults

The default breakpoints are shown below.

```python eval
rx.table.root(
    rx.table.header(
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Size"),
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Width"),
        ),
    ),
    rx.table.body(
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.cell(rx.code("initial", style=get_code_style("violet"))),
            rx.table.cell("0px", style=cell_style),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.cell(rx.code("xs", style=get_code_style("violet"))),
            rx.table.cell("30em", style=cell_style),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.cell(rx.code("sm", style=get_code_style("violet"))),
            rx.table.cell("48em", style=cell_style),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.cell(rx.code("md", style=get_code_style("violet"))),
            rx.table.cell("62em", style=cell_style),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.cell(rx.code("lg", style=get_code_style("violet"))),
            rx.table.cell("80em", style=cell_style),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.cell(rx.code("xl", style=get_code_style("violet"))),
            rx.table.cell("96em", style=cell_style),
        ),
    ),
    margin_bottom="1em",
)
```

You can customize them using the style property.

```python
app = rx.App(style=\{"breakpoints": ["520px", "768px", "1024px", "1280px", "1640px"]\})
```

## Showing Components Based on Display

A common use case for responsive is to show different components based on the screen size.

Reflex provides useful helper components for this.

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.desktop_only(
        rx.text("Desktop View"),
    ),
    rx.tablet_only(
        rx.text("Tablet View"),
    ),
    rx.mobile_only(
        rx.text("Mobile View"),
    ),
    rx.mobile_and_tablet(
        rx.text("Visible on Mobile and Tablet"),
    ),
    rx.tablet_and_desktop(
        rx.text("Visible on Desktop and Tablet"),
    ),
)
```

## Specifying Display Breakpoints

You can specify the breakpoints to use for the responsive components by using the `display` style property.

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.text(
        "Hello World",
        color="green",
        display=["none", "none", "none", "none", "flex"],
    ),
    rx.text(
        "Hello World",
        color="blue",
        display=["none", "none", "none", "flex", "flex"],
    ),
    rx.text(
        "Hello World",
        color="red",
        display=["none", "none", "flex", "flex", "flex"],
    ),
    rx.text(
        "Hello World",
        color="orange",
        display=["none", "flex", "flex", "flex", "flex"],
    ),
    rx.text(
        "Hello World",
        color="yellow",
        display=["flex", "flex", "flex", "flex", "flex"],
    ),
)
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import styling, library
```

# Styling

Reflex components can be styled using the full power of [CSS]({"https://www.w3schools.com/css/"}).

There are three main ways to add style to your app and they take precedence in the following order:

1. **Inline:** Styles applied to a single component instance.
2. **Component:** Styles applied to components of a specific type.
3. **Global:** Styles applied to all components.

```md alert success
# Style keys can be any valid CSS property name.
To be consistent with Python standards, you can specify keys in `snake_case`.
```

## Global Styles

You can pass a style dictionary to your app to apply base styles to all components.

For example, you can set the default font family and font size for your app here just once rather than having to set it on every component.

```python
style = {
    "font_family": "Comic Sans MS",
    "font_size": "16px",
}

app = rx.App(style=style)
```

## Component Styles

In your style dictionary, you can also specify default styles for specific component types or arbitrary CSS classes and IDs.

```python
style = {
    # Set the selection highlight color globally.
    "::selection": {
        "background_color": accent_color,
    },
    # Apply global css class styles.
    ".some-css-class": {
        "text_decoration": "underline",
    },
    # Apply global css id styles.
    "#special-input": \{"width": "20vw"},
    # Apply styles to specific components.
    rx.text: {
        "font_family": "Comic Sans MS",
    },
    rx.divider: {
        "margin_bottom": "1em",
        "margin_top": "0.5em",
    },
    rx.heading: {
        "font_weight": "500",
    },
    rx.code: {
        "color": "green",
    },
}

app = rx.App(style=style)
```

Using style dictionaries like this, you can easily create a consistent theme for your app.


```md alert warning
# Watch out for underscores in class names and IDs
Reflex automatically converts `snake_case` identifiers into `camelCase` format when applying styles. To ensure consistency, it is recommended to use the dash character or camelCase identifiers in your own class names and IDs. To style third-party libraries relying on underscore class names, an external stylesheet should be used. See [custom stylesheets]({styling.custom_stylesheets.path}) for how to reference external CSS files.
```

## Inline Styles

Inline styles apply to a single component instance. They are passed in as regular props to the component.

```python demo
rx.text(
    "Hello World",
    background_image="linear-gradient(271.68deg, #EE756A 0.75%, #756AEE 88.52%)",
    background_clip="text",
    font_weight="bold",
    font_size="2em",
)
```

Children components inherit inline styles unless they are overridden by their own inline styles.

```python demo
rx.box(
    rx.hstack(
        rx.button("Default Button"),
        rx.button("Red Button", color="red"),
    ),
    color="blue",
)
```

### Style Prop

Inline styles can also be set with a `style` prop. This is useful for reusing styles between multiple components.

```python exec
text_style = {
    "color": "green",
    "font_family": "Comic Sans MS",
    "font_size": "1.2em",
    "font_weight": "bold",
    "box_shadow": "rgba(240, 46, 170, 0.4) 5px 5px, rgba(240, 46, 170, 0.3) 10px 10px",
}
```

```python
text_style={text_style}
```

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.text("Hello", style=text_style),
    rx.text("World", style=text_style),
)
```

```python exec
style1 = {
    "color": "green",
    "font_family": "Comic Sans MS",
    "border_radius": "10px",
    "background_color": "rgb(107,99,246)",
}
style2 = {
    "color": "white",
    "border": "5px solid #EE756A",
    "padding": "10px",
}
```

```python
style1={style1}
style2={style2}
```

```python demo
rx.box(
    "Multiple Styles",
    style=[style1, style2],
)
```

The style dictionaries are applied in the order they are passed in. This means that styles defined later will override styles defined earlier.


## Theming

As of Reflex 'v0.4.0', you can now theme your Reflex web apps. To learn more checkout the [Theme docs]({styling.theming.path}).

The `Theme` component is used to change the theme of the application. The `Theme` can be set directly in your rx.App.

```python
app = rx.App(
    theme=rx.theme(
        appearance="light", has_background=True, radius="large", accent_color="teal"
    )
)
```

Additionally you can modify the theme of your app through using the `Theme Panel` component which can be found in the [Theme Panel docs]({library.other.theme.path}).

## Special Styles

We support all of Chakra UI's [pseudo styles]({"https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/style-props#pseudo"}).

Below is an example of text that changes color when you hover over it.

```python demo
rx.box(
    rx.text("Hover Me", _hover={"color": "red"}),
)
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import library
from pcweb.styles.styles import get_code_style_rdx, cell_style
```

# Theming

As of Reflex `v0.4.0`, you can now theme your Reflex applications. The core of our theming system is directly based on the [Radix Themes](https://www.radix-ui.com) library. This allows you to easily change the theme of your application along with providing a default light and dark theme. Themes cause all the components to have a unified color appearance.

## Overview

The `Theme` component is used to change the theme of the application. The `Theme` can be set directly in your rx.App.

```python
app = rx.App(
    theme=rx.theme(
        appearance="light", has_background=True, radius="large", accent_color="teal"
    )
)
```

Here are the props that can be passed to the `rx.theme` component:

```python eval
rx.table.root(
    rx.table.header(
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Name", class_name="table-header"),
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Type", class_name="table-header"),
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Description", class_name="table-header"),
        ),
    ),
    rx.table.body(
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.row_header_cell(rx.code("has_background", style=get_code_style_rdx("violet"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.code("Bool", style=get_code_style_rdx("gray"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell("Whether to apply the themes background color to the theme node. Defaults to True.", style=cell_style),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.row_header_cell(rx.code("appearance", style=get_code_style_rdx("violet"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.code('"inherit" | "light" | "dark"', style=get_code_style_rdx("gray"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell("The appearance of the theme. Can be 'light' or 'dark'. Defaults to 'light'.", style=cell_style),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.row_header_cell(rx.code("accent_color", style=get_code_style_rdx("violet"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.code("Str", style=get_code_style_rdx("gray"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell("The primary color used for default buttons, typography, backgrounds, etc.", style=cell_style),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.row_header_cell(rx.code("gray_color", style=get_code_style_rdx("violet"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.code("Str", style=get_code_style_rdx("gray"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell("The secondary color used for default buttons, typography, backgrounds, etc.", style=cell_style),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.row_header_cell(rx.code("panel_background", style=get_code_style_rdx("violet"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.code('"solid" | "translucent"', style=get_code_style_rdx("gray"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell('Whether panel backgrounds are translucent: "solid" | "translucent" (default).', style=cell_style),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.row_header_cell(rx.code("radius", style=get_code_style_rdx("violet"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.code('"none" | "small" | "medium" | "large" | "full"', style=get_code_style_rdx("gray"))),
            rx.table.cell("The radius of the theme. Can be 'small', 'medium', or 'large'. Defaults to 'medium'.", style=cell_style),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.row_header_cell(rx.code("scaling", style=get_code_style_rdx("violet"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.code('"90%" | "95%" | "100%" | "105%" | "110%"', style=get_code_style_rdx("gray"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell("Scale of all theme items.", style=cell_style),
        ),
    ),
    variant="surface",
    margin_y="1em",
)

```

Additionally you can modify the theme of your app through using the `Theme Panel` component which can be found in the [Theme Panel docs]({library.other.theme.path}).


## Colors

### Color Scheme

On a high-level, component `color_scheme` inherits from the color specified in the theme. This means that if you change the theme, the color of the component will also change. Available colors can be found [here](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors).

You can also specify the `color_scheme` prop.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.button(
        "Hello World",
        color_scheme="tomato",
    ),
    rx.button(
        "Hello World",
        color_scheme="teal",
    ),
    spacing="2"
)
```

### Shades

Sometime you may want to use a specific shade of a color from the theme. This is recommended vs using a hex color directly as it will automatically change when the theme changes appearance change from light/dark.


To access a specific shade of color from the theme, you can use the `rx.color`. When switching to light and dark themes, the color will automatically change. Shades can be accessed by using the color name and the shade number. The shade number ranges from 1 to 12. Additionally, they can have their alpha value set by using the `True` parameter it defaults to `False`. A full list of colors can be found [here](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors).

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.button(
        "Hello World",
        color=rx.color("grass", 1),
        background_color=rx.color("grass", 7),
        border_color=f"1px solid {rx.color('grass', 1)}",
    ),
    spacing="2"
)
```

```python eval
rx.table.root(
    rx.table.header(
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Type"),
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Description"),
        ),
    ),
    rx.table.body(
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.row_header_cell(rx.code("color", style=get_code_style_rdx("violet"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.code("Str", style=get_code_style_rdx("gray"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell("The color to use. Can be any valid accent color or 'accent' to reference the current theme color.", style=cell_style),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.row_header_cell(rx.code("shade", style=get_code_style_rdx("violet"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.link(rx.code('1 - 12', style=get_code_style_rdx("gray"), class_name="code-style"), href="https://www.radix-ui.com/colors")),
            rx.table.cell("The shade of the color to use. Defaults to 7.", style=cell_style),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.row_header_cell(rx.code("alpha", style=get_code_style_rdx("violet"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.code("Bool", style=get_code_style_rdx("gray"), class_name="code-style")),
            rx.table.cell("Whether to use the alpha value of the color. Defaults to False.", style=cell_style),
        )
    ),
    variant="surface",
    margin_y="1em",
)

```

### Regular Colors

You can also use standard hex, rgb, and rgba colors.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.button(
        "Hello World",
        color="white",
        background_color="#87CEFA",
        border="1px solid rgb(176,196,222)",
    ),
    spacing="2"
)
```

## Toggle Appearance

To toggle between the light and dark mode manually, you can use the `toggle_color_mode` with the desired event trigger of your choice.

```python

from reflex.style import toggle_color_mode



def index():
    return rx.button(
        "Toggle Color Mode",
        on_click=toggle_color_mode,
    )
```

## Appearance Conditional Rendering

To render a different component depending on whether the app is in `light` mode or `dark` mode, you can use the `rx.color_mode_cond` component. The first component will be rendered if the app is in `light` mode and the second component will be rendered if the app is in `dark` mode.

```python demo
rx.color_mode_cond(
    light=rx.image(src="/logos/light/reflex.svg", alt="Reflex Logo light", height="4em"),
    dark=rx.image(src="/logos/dark/reflex.svg", alt="Reflex Logo dark", height="4em"),
)
```

This can also be applied to props.

```python demo
rx.button(
    "Hello World",
    color=rx.color_mode_cond(light="black", dark="white"),
    background_color=rx.color_mode_cond(light="white", dark="black"),
)
```

Any [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) prop can be used in a component in Reflex. This is a short list of the most commonly used props. To see all CSS props that can be used check out this [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). 

Hyphens in CSS property names may be replaced by underscores to use as valid python identifiers, i.e. the CSS prop `z-index` would be used as `z_index` in Reflex.

```python eval
rx.table.root(
    rx.table.header(
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.column_header_cell(
                "Prop", justify="center"
            ),
            rx.table.column_header_cell(
                "Description",
                justify="center",
                
            ),
            rx.table.column_header_cell(
                "Potential Values",
                justify="center",
            ),
        )
    ),
    rx.table.body(
        *[show_props(key, props) for key in props]
    ),
    width="100%",
    padding_x="0",
    size="1",
)
```

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Layout Components

Layout components such as `rx.flex`, `rx.container`, `rx.box`, etc. are used to organize and structure the visual presentation of your application. This page gives a breakdown of when and how each of these components might be used.

```md video https://youtube.com/embed/ITOZkzjtjUA?start=3311&end=3853
# Video: Example of Laying Out the Main Content of a Page
```

## Box

`rx.box` is a generic component that can apply any CSS style to its children. It's a building block that can be used to apply a specific layout or style property.

**When to use:** Use `rx.box` when you need to apply specific styles or constraints to a part of your interface.


```python demo
rx.box(
    rx.box(
        "CSS color",
        background_color="red",
        border_radius="2px",
        width="50%",
        margin="4px",
        padding="4px",
    ),
    rx.box(
        "Radix Color",
        background_color=rx.color("tomato", 3),
        border_radius="5px",
        width="80%",
        margin="12px",
        padding="12px",
    ),
    text_align="center",
    width="100%",
)
```

## Stack

`rx.stack` is a layout component that arranges its children in a single column or row, depending on the direction. It’s useful for consistent spacing between elements.

**When to use:** Use `rx.stack` when you need to lay out a series of components either vertically or horizontally with equal spacing.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.stack(
        rx.box(
            "Example",
            bg="orange",
            border_radius="3px",
            width="20%",
        ),
        rx.box(
            "Example",
            bg="lightblue",
            border_radius="3px",
            width="30%",
        ),
        flex_direction="row",
        width="100%",
    ),
    rx.stack(
        rx.box(
            "Example",
            bg="orange",
            border_radius="3px",
            width="20%",
        ),
        rx.box(
            "Example",
            bg="lightblue",
            border_radius="3px",
            width="30%",
        ),
        flex_direction="column",
        width="100%",
    ),
    width="100%",
)
```

## Flex

The `rx.flex` component is used to create a flexible box layout, inspired by [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox). It's ideal for designing a layout where the size of the items can grow and shrink dynamically based on the available space.

**When to use:** Use `rx.flex` when you need a responsive layout that adjusts the size and position of child components dynamically.


```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.card("Card 1"),
    rx.card("Card 2"),
    rx.card("Card 3"),
    spacing="2",
    width="100%",
)
```


## Grid

`rx.grid` components are used to create complex responsive layouts based on a grid system, similar to [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout).

**When to use:** Use `rx.grid` when dealing with complex layouts that require rows and columns, especially when alignment and spacing among multiple axes are needed.

```python demo
rx.grid(
    rx.foreach(
        rx.Var.range(12),
        lambda i: rx.card(f"Card {i + 1}", height="10vh"),
    ),
    columns="3",
    spacing="4",
    width="100%",
)
```

## Container

The `rx.container` component typically provides padding and fixes the maximum width of the content inside it, often used to center content on large screens.

**When to use:** Use `rx.container` for wrapping your application’s content in a centered block with some padding.

```python demo
rx.box(
    rx.container(
        rx.card(
            "This content is constrained to a max width of 448px.",
            width="100%",
        ),
        size="1",
    ),
    rx.container(
        rx.card(
            "This content is constrained to a max width of 688px.",
            width="100%",
        ),
        size="2",
    ),
    rx.container(
        rx.card(
            "This content is constrained to a max width of 880px.",
            width="100%",
        ),
        size="3",
    ),
    background_color="var(--gray-3)",
    width="100%",
)
```


When wrapping a React component, you may need to define custom code or hooks that are specific to the component. This is done by defining the `add_custom_code`or `add_hooks` methods in your component class.

## Custom Code

Custom code is any JS code that need to be included in your page, but not necessarily in the component itself. This can include things like CSS styles, JS libraries, or any other code that needs to be included in the page.

```python
class CustomCodeComponent(MyBaseComponent):
    """MyComponent."""

    def add_custom_code(self) -> list[str]:
        """Add custom code to the component."""
        code1 = """const customVariable = "Custom code1";"""
        code2 = """console.log(customVariable);"""

        return [code1, code2]
```

The above example will render the following JS code in the page:

```javascript
/* import here */

const customVariable = "Custom code1";
console.log(customVariable);

/* rest of the page code */
```

## Custom Hooks
Custom hooks are any hooks that need to be included in your component. This can include things like `useEffect`, `useState`, or any other hooks from the library you are wrapping.

- Simple hooks can be added as strings.
- More complex hooks that need to have special import or be written in a specific order can be added as `rx.Var` with a `VarData` object to specify the position of the hook.
    - The `imports` attribute of the `VarData` object can be used to specify any imports that need to be included in the component.
    - The `position` attribute of the `VarData` object can be set to `Hooks.HookPosition.PRE_TRIGGER` or `Hooks.HookPosition.POST_TRIGGER` to specify the position of the hook in the component.

```md alert info
# The `position` attribute is only used for hooks that need to be written in a specific order. 
- If an event handler need to refer to a variable defined in a hook, the hook should be written before the event handler.
- If a hook need to refer to the memoized event handler by name, the hook should be written after the event handler.
```

```python
from reflex.vars.base import Var, VarData
from reflex.constants import Hooks
from reflex.components.el.elements import Div

class ComponentWithHooks(Div, MyBaseComponent):
    """MyComponent."""

    def add_hooks(self) -> list[str| Var]:
        """Add hooks to the component."""
        hooks = []
        hooks1 = """const customHookVariable = "some value";"""
        hooks.append(hooks1)

        # A hook that need to be written before the memoized event handlers.
        hooks2 = Var(
            """useEffect(() => {
                console.log("PreTrigger: " + customHookVariable);
            }, []);
            """,
            _var_data=VarData(
                imports=\{"react": ["useEffect"],\},
                position=Hooks.HookPosition.PRE_TRIGGER
            ),
        )
        hooks.append(hooks2)

        hooks3 = Var(
            """useEffect(() => {
                console.log("PostTrigger: " + customHookVariable);
            }, []);
            """,
            _var_data=VarData(
                imports=\{"react": ["useEffect"],\},
                position=Hooks.HookPosition.POST_TRIGGER
            ),
        )
        hooks.append(hooks3)
        return hooks
```

The `ComponentWithHooks` will be rendered in the component in the following way:

```javascript
export function Div_7178f430b7b371af8a12d8265d65ab9b() {
  const customHookVariable = "some value";

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("PreTrigger: " + customHookVariable);
  }, []);

  /* memoized triggers such as on_click, on_change, etc will render here */

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("PostTrigger: "+ customHookVariable);
  }, []);

  return jsx("div", \{\});
}
```

```md alert info
# You can mix custom code and hooks in the same component. Hooks can access a variable defined in the custom code, but custom code cannot access a variable defined in a hook.
```

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Assets

If a wrapped component depends on assets such as images, scripts, or
stylesheets, these can be kept adjacent to the component code and
included in the final build using the `rx.asset` function.

`rx.asset` returns a relative path that references the asset in the compiled
output. The target files are copied into a subdirectory of `assets/external`
based on the module where they are initially used. This allows third-party
components to have external assets with the same name without conflicting
with each other.

For example, if there is an SVG file named `wave.svg` in the same directory as
this component, it can be rendered using `rx.image` and `rx.asset`.

```python
class Hello(rx.Component):
    @classmethod
    def create(cls, *children, **props) -> rx.Component:
        props.setdefault("align", "center")
        return rx.hstack(
            rx.image(src=rx.asset("wave.svg", shared=True), width="50px", height="50px"),
            rx.heading("Hello ", *children),
            **props
        )
```


# Local Components

You can also wrap components that you have written yourself. For local components (when the code source is directly in the project), we recommend putting it beside the files that is wrapping it.

If there is a file `hello.jsx` in the same directory as the component with this content:

```javascript
// /path/to/components/hello.jsx
import React from 'react';

export function Hello({name, onGreet}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      <button onClick={() => onGreet(name)}>Greet</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The python app can use the `rx.asset` helper to copy the component source into
the generated frontend, after which the `library` path in the `rx.Component` may
be specified by prefixing `$/public` to that path returned by `rx.asset`.

```python
import reflex as rx

hello_path = rx.asset("./hello.jsx", shared=True)
hello_css_path = rx.asset("./hello.css", shared=True)

class Hello(rx.Component):
    # Use an absolute path starting with $/public
    library = f"$/public{hello_path}"

    # Define everything else as normal.
    tag = "Hello"

    name: rx.Var[str] = rx.Var.create("World")
    on_greet: rx.EventHandler[rx.event.passthrough_event_spec(str)]

    # Include any related CSS files with rx.asset to ensure they are copied.
    def add_imports(self):
        return {"": f"$/public/{hello_css_path}"}
```

## Considerations

When wrapping local components, keep the following in mind:

1. **File Extensions**: Ensure that the file extensions are correct (e.g., `.jsx` for React components and `.tsx` for TypeScript components).
2. **Asset Management**: Use `rx.asset` with `shared=True` to manage any assets (e.g., images, styles) that the component depends on.
3. **Event Handling**: Define any event handlers (e.g., `on_greet`) as part of the component's API and pass those to the component _from the Reflex app_. Do not attempt to hook into Reflex's event system directly from Javascript.

## Use Case

Local components are useful when shimming small pieces of functionality that are
simpler or more performant when implemented directly in Javascript, such as:

* Spammy events: keys, touch, mouse, scroll -- these are often better processed on the client side.
* Using canvas, graphics or WebGPU
* Working with other Web APIs like storage, screen capture, audio/midi
* Integrating with complex third-party libraries
  * For application-specific use, it may be easier to wrap a local component that
    provides the needed subset of the library's functionality in a simpler API for use in Reflex.

# Local Packages

If the component is part of a local package, available on Github, or
downloadable via a web URL, it can also be wrapped in Reflex. Specify the path
or URL after an `@` following the package name.

Any local paths are relative to the `.web` folder, so you can use `../` prefix
to reference the Reflex project root.

Some examples of valid specifiers for a package called 
[`@masenf/hello-react`](https://github.com/masenf/hello-react) are:

* GitHub: `@masenf/hello-react@github:masenf/hello-react`
* URL: `@masenf/hello-react@https://github.com/masenf/hello-react/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz`
* Local Archive: `@masenf/hello-react@../hello-react.tgz`
* Local Directory: `@masenf/hello-react@../hello-react`

It is important that the package name matches the name in `package.json` so
Reflex can generate the correct import statement in the generated javascript
code.

These package specifiers can be used for `library` or `lib_dependencies`.

```python demo exec toggle
class GithubComponent(rx.Component):
    library = "@masenf/hello-react@github:masenf/hello-react"
    tag = "Counter"

    def add_imports(self):
        return {
            "": ["@masenf/hello-react/dist/style.css"]
        }

def github_component_example():
    return GithubComponent.create()
```

Although more complicated, this approach is useful when the local components
have additional dependencies or build steps required to prepare the component
for use.

Some important notes regarding this approach:

* The repo or archive must contain a `package.json` file.
* `prepare` or `build` scripts will NOT be executed. The distribution archive,
  directory, or repo must already contain the built javascript files (this is common).

```md alert
# Ensure CSS files are exported in `package.json`

In addition to exporting the module containing the component, any CSS files
intended to be imported by the wrapped component must also be listed in the
`exports` key of `package.json`.

```json
{
  // ...,
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/index.js",
      "require": "./dist/index.umd.cjs"
    },
    "./dist/style.css": {
      "import": "./dist/style.css",
      "require": "./dist/style.css"
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from typing import Any
```

# Complex Example

In this more complex example we will be wrapping `reactflow` a library for building node based applications like flow charts, diagrams, graphs, etc.

## Import

Lets start by importing the library [reactflow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactflow). Lets make a separate file called `reactflow.py` and add the following code:

```python
import reflex as rx
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Union

class ReactFlowLib(rx.Component):
    """A component that wraps a react flow lib."""

    library = "reactflow"

    def _get_custom_code(self) -> str:
        return """import 'reactflow/dist/style.css';
        """
```

Notice we also use the `_get_custom_code` method to import the css file that is needed for the styling of the library.

## Components

For this tutorial we will wrap three components from Reactflow: `ReactFlow`, `Background`, and `Controls`. Lets start with the `ReactFlow` component.

Here we will define the `tag` and the `vars` that we will need to use the component.

For this tutorial we will define `EventHandler` props `on_nodes_change` and `on_connect`, but you can find all the events that the component triggers in the [reactflow docs](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/react-flow-props/#onnodeschange).

```python
import reflex as rx
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Union

class ReactFlowLib(rx.Component):
    ...

class ReactFlow(ReactFlowLib):

    tag = "ReactFlow"

    nodes: rx.Var[List[Dict[str, Any]]]

    edges: rx.Var[List[Dict[str, Any]]]

    fit_view: rx.Var[bool]

    nodes_draggable: rx.Var[bool]

    nodes_connectable: rx.Var[bool]

    nodes_focusable: rx.Var[bool]

    on_nodes_change: rx.EventHandler[lambda e0: [e0]]

    on_connect: rx.EventHandler[lambda e0: [e0]]
```

Now lets add the `Background` and `Controls` components. We will also create the components using the `create` method so that we can use them in our app.

```python
import reflex as rx
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Union

class ReactFlowLib(rx.Component):
    ...

class ReactFlow(ReactFlowLib):
    ...

class Background(ReactFlowLib):

    tag = "Background"

    color: rx.Var[str]

    gap: rx.Var[int]

    size: rx.Var[int]

    variant: rx.Var[str]

class Controls(ReactFlowLib):

    tag = "Controls"

react_flow = ReactFlow.create
background = Background.create
controls = Controls.create
```

## Building the App

Now that we have our components lets build the app.

Lets start by defining the initial nodes and edges that we will use in our app.

```python
import reflex as rx
from .react_flow import react_flow, background, controls
import random
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import Any, Dict, List


initial_nodes = [
    \{
        'id': '1',
        'type': 'input',
        'data': \{'label': '150'},
        'position': \{'x': 250, 'y': 25},
    },
    \{
        'id': '2',
        'data': \{'label': '25'},
        'position': \{'x': 100, 'y': 125},
    },
    \{
        'id': '3',
        'type': 'output',
        'data': \{'label': '5'},
        'position': \{'x': 250, 'y': 250},
    },
]

initial_edges = [
    \{'id': 'e1-2', 'source': '1', 'target': '2', 'label': '*', 'animated': True},
    \{'id': 'e2-3', 'source': '2', 'target': '3', 'label': '+', 'animated': True},
]
```

Next we will define the state of our app. We have four event handlers: `add_random_node`, `clear_graph`, `on_connect` and `on_nodes_change`.

The `on_nodes_change` event handler is triggered when a node is selected and dragged. This function is used to update the position of a node during dragging. It takes a single argument `node_changes`, which is a list of dictionaries containing various types of metadata. For updating positions, the function specifically processes changes of type `position`.

```python
class State(rx.State):
    """The app state."""
    nodes: List[Dict[str, Any]] = initial_nodes
    edges: List[Dict[str, Any]] = initial_edges

    @rx.event
    def add_random_node(self):
        new_node_id = f'\{len(self.nodes) + 1\}'
        node_type = random.choice(['default'])
        # Label is random number
        label = new_node_id
        x = random.randint(0, 500)
        y = random.randint(0, 500)

        new_node = {
            'id': new_node_id,
            'type': node_type,
            'data': \{'label': label},
            'position': \{'x': x, 'y': y},
            'draggable': True,
        }
        self.nodes.append(new_node)

    @rx.event
    def clear_graph(self):
        self.nodes = []  # Clear the nodes list
        self.edges = []  # Clear the edges list

    @rx.event
    def on_connect(self, new_edge):
        # Iterate over the existing edges
        for i, edge in enumerate(self.edges):
            # If we find an edge with the same ID as the new edge
            if edge["id"] == f"e\{new_edge['source']}-\{new_edge['target']}":
                # Delete the existing edge
                del self.edges[i]
                break

        # Add the new edge
        self.edges.append({
            "id": f"e\{new_edge['source']}-\{new_edge['target']}",
            "source": new_edge["source"],
            "target": new_edge["target"],
            "label": random.choice(["+", "-", "*", "/"]),
            "animated": True,
        })

    @rx.event
    def on_nodes_change(self, node_changes: List[Dict[str, Any]]):
        # Receives a list of Nodes in case of events like dragging
        map_id_to_new_position = defaultdict(dict)

        # Loop over the changes and store the new position
        for change in node_changes:
            if change["type"] == "position" and change.get("dragging") == True:
                map_id_to_new_position[change["id"]] = change["position"]

        # Loop over the nodes and update the position
        for i, node in enumerate(self.nodes):
            if node["id"] in map_id_to_new_position:
                new_position = map_id_to_new_position[node["id"]]
                self.nodes[i]["position"] = new_position
```

Now lets define the UI of our app. We will use the `react_flow` component and pass in the `nodes` and `edges` from our state. We will also add the `on_connect` event handler to the `react_flow` component to handle when an edge is connected.

```python
def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.vstack(
        react_flow(
            background(),
            controls(),
            nodes_draggable=True,
            nodes_connectable=True,
            on_connect=lambda e0: State.on_connect(e0),
            on_nodes_change=lambda e0: State.on_nodes_change(e0),
            nodes=State.nodes,
            edges=State.edges,
            fit_view=True,
        ),
        rx.hstack(
            rx.button("Clear graph", on_click=State.clear_graph, width="100%"),
            rx.button("Add node", on_click=State.add_random_node, width="100%"),
            width="100%",
        ),
        height="30em",
        width="100%",
    )


# Add state and page to the app.
app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index)
```

```python exec

title: Props - Wrapping React 
---

# Props

When wrapping a React component, you want to define the props that will be accepted by the component.
This is done by defining the props and annotating them with a `rx.Var`.

Broadly, there are three kinds of props you can encounter when wrapping a React component:
1. **Simple Props**: These are props that are passed directly to the component. They can be of any type, including strings, numbers, booleans, and even lists or dictionaries.
2. **Callback Props**: These are props that expect to receive a function. That function will usually be called by the component as a callback. (This is different from event handlers.)
3. **Component Props**: These are props that expect to receive a components themselves. They can be used to create more complex components by composing them together.
4. **Event Handlers**: These are props that expect to receive a function that will be called when an event occurs. They are defined as `rx.EventHandler` with a signature function to define the spec of the event.

## Simple Props

Simple props are the most common type of props you will encounter when wrapping a React component. They are passed directly to the component and can be of any type (but most commonly strings, numbers, booleans, and structures).

For custom types, you can use `TypedDict` to define the structure of the custom types. However, if you need the attributes to be automatically converted to camelCase once compiled in JS, you can use `rx.PropsBase` instead of `TypedDict`.

```python
class CustomReactType(TypedDict):
    """Custom React type."""

    # Define the structure of the custom type to match the Javascript structure.
    attribute1: str
    attribute2: bool
    attribute3: int


class CustomReactType2(rx.PropsBase):
    """Custom React type."""

    # Define the structure of the custom type to match the Javascript structure.
    attr_foo: str # will be attrFoo in JS
    attr_bar: bool # will be attrBar in JS
    attr_baz: int # will be attrBaz in JS

class SimplePropsComponent(MyBaseComponent):
    """MyComponent."""

    # Type the props according the component documentation.
    
    # props annotated as `string` in javascript
    prop1: rx.Var[str] 
    
    # props annotated as `number` in javascript
    prop2: rx.Var[int]
    
    # props annotated as `boolean` in javascript
    prop3: rx.Var[bool] 
    
    # props annotated as `string[]` in javascript
    prop4: rx.Var[list[str]] 
    
    # props annotated as `CustomReactType` in javascript
    props5: rx.Var[CustomReactType] 

    # props annotated as `CustomReactType2` in javascript
    props6: rx.Var[CustomReactType2]

    # Sometimes a props will accept multiple types. You can use `|` to specify the types.
    # props annotated as `string | boolean` in javascript
    props7: rx.Var[str | bool] 
```

## Callback Props

Callback props are used to handle events or to pass data back to the parent component. They are defined as `rx.Var` with a type of `FunctionVar` or `Callable`.

```python
from typing import Callable
from reflex.vars.function import FunctionVar

class CallbackPropsComponent(MyBaseComponent):
    """MyComponent."""

    # A callback prop that takes a single argument.
    callback_props: rx.Var[Callable]
```

## Component Props
Some components will occasionally accept other components as props, usually annotated as `ReactNode`. In Reflex, these are defined as `rx.Component`.

```python
class ComponentPropsComponent(MyBaseComponent):
    """MyComponent."""

    # A prop that takes a component as an argument.
    component_props: rx.Var[rx.Component]
```

## Event Handlers
Event handlers are props that expect to receive a function that will be called when an event occurs. They are defined as `rx.EventHandler` with a signature function to define the spec of the event.

```python
from reflex.vars.event_handler import EventHandler
from reflex.vars.function import FunctionVar
from reflex.vars.object import ObjectVar

class InputEventType(TypedDict):
    """Input event type."""

    # Define the structure of the input event.
    foo: str
    bar: int

class OutputEventType(TypedDict):
    """Output event type."""

    # Define the structure of the output event.
    baz: str
    qux: int


def custom_spec1(event: ObjectVar[InputEventType]) -> tuple[str, int]:
    """Custom event spec using ObjectVar with custom type as input and tuple as output."""
    return (
        event.foo.to(str),
        event.bar.to(int),
    )

def custom_spec2(event: ObjectVar[dict]) -> tuple[Var[OutputEventType]]:
    """Custom event spec using ObjectVar with dict as input and custom type as output."""
    return Var.create(
        {
            "baz": event["foo"],
            "qux": event["bar"],
        },
    ).to(OutputEventType)

class EventHandlerComponent(MyBaseComponent):
    """MyComponent."""

    # An event handler that take no argument.
    on_event: rx.EventHandler[rx.event.no_args_event_spec]

    # An event handler that takes a single string argument.
    on_event_with_arg: rx.EventHandler[rx.event.passthrough_event_spec(str)]

    # An event handler specialized for input events, accessing event.target.value from the event.
    on_input_change: rx.EventHandler[rx.event.input_event]

    # An event handler specialized for key events, accessing event.key from the event and provided modifiers (ctrl, alt, shift, meta).
    on_key_down: rx.EventHandler[rx.event.key_event]

    # An event handler that takes a custom spec. (Event handler must expect a tuple of two values [str and int])
    on_custom_event: rx.EventHandler[custom_spec1]

    # Another event handler that takes a custom spec. (Event handler must expect a tuple of one value, being a OutputEventType)
    on_custom_event2: rx.EventHandler[custom_spec2]
```

```md alert info
# Custom event specs have a few use case where they are particularly useful. If the event returns non-serializable data, you can filter them out so the event can be sent to the backend. You can also use them to transform the data before sending it to the backend.
```

### Emulating Event Handler Behavior Outside a Component

In some instances, you may need to replicate the special behavior applied to
event handlers from outside of a component context. For example if the component
to be wrapped requires event callbacks passed in a dictionary, this can be
achieved by directly instantiating an `EventChain`.

A real-world example of this is the `onEvents` prop of
[`echarts-for-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/echarts-for-react) library,
which, unlike a normal event handler, expects a mapping of event handlers like:

```javascript
<ReactECharts
  option={this.getOption()}
  style={{ height: '300px', width: '100%' }}
  onEvents={{
    'click': this.onChartClick,
    'legendselectchanged': this.onChartLegendselectchanged
  }}
/>
```

To achieve this in Reflex, you can create an explicit `EventChain` for each
event handler:

```python
@classmethod
def create(cls, *children, **props):
    on_events = props.pop("on_events", {})

    event_chains = {}
    for event_name, handler in on_events.items():
        # Convert the EventHandler/EventSpec/lambda to an EventChain
        event_chains[event_name] = rx.EventChain.create(
            handler,
            args_spec=rx.event.no_args_event_spec,
            key=event_name,
        )
    if on_events:
        props["on_events"] = event_chains

    # Create the component instance
    return super().create(*children, **props)
```

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from typing import Any
from pcweb.components.spline import spline
from pcweb.pages.docs import custom_components
from pcweb import constants
```

# Wrapping React

One of Reflex's most powerful features is the ability to wrap React components and take advantage of the vast ecosystem of React libraries.

If you want a specific component for your app but Reflex doesn't provide it, there's a good chance it's available as a React component. Search for it on [npm]({constants.NPMJS_URL}), and if it's there, you can use it in your Reflex app. You can also create your own local React components and wrap them in Reflex.

Once you wrap your component, you [publish it]({custom_components.overview.path}) to the Reflex library so that others can use it.

## Simple Example

Simple components that don't have any interaction can be wrapped with just a few lines of code. 

Below we show how to wrap the [Spline]({constants.SPLINE_URL}) library can be used to create 3D scenes and animations.

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx

class Spline(rx.Component):
    """Spline component."""

    # The name of the npm package.
    library = "@splinetool/react-spline"

    # Any additional libraries needed to use the component.
    lib_dependencies: list[str] = ["@splinetool/runtime@1.5.5"]

    # The name of the component to use from the package.
    tag = "Spline"

    # Spline is a default export from the module.
    is_default = True

    # Any props that the component takes.
    scene: rx.Var[str]

# Convenience function to create the Spline component.
spline = Spline.create

# Use the Spline component in your app.
def index():
    return spline(scene="https://prod.spline.design/joLpOOYbGL-10EJ4/scene.splinecode")
```


## ColorPicker Example

Similar to the Spline example we start with defining the library and tag. In this case the library is `react-colorful` and the tag is `HexColorPicker`.

We also have a var `color` which is the current color of the color picker.

Since this component has interaction we must specify any event triggers that the component takes. The color picker has a single trigger `on_change` to specify when the color changes. This trigger takes in a single argument `color` which is the new color.

```python exec
from reflex.components.component import NoSSRComponent

class ColorPicker(NoSSRComponent):
    library = "react-colorful"
    tag = "HexColorPicker"
    color: rx.Var[str]
    on_change: rx.EventHandler[lambda color: [color]]

color_picker = ColorPicker.create

ColorPickerState = rx._x.client_state(default="#db114b", var_name="color")
```

```python eval
rx.box(
    ColorPickerState,
    rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(ColorPickerState.value, color="white"),
        color_picker(
            on_change=ColorPickerState.set_value
        ),
    ),
    background_color=ColorPickerState.value,
    padding="5em",
    border_radius="12px",
    margin_bottom="1em",
)
```

```python
from reflex.components.component import NoSSRComponent

class ColorPicker(NoSSRComponent):
    library = "react-colorful"
    tag = "HexColorPicker"
    color: rx.Var[str]
    on_change: rx.EventHandler[lambda color: [color]]

color_picker = ColorPicker.create

class ColorPickerState(rx.State):
    color: str = "#db114b"

def index():
    return rx.box(
        rx.vstack(
            rx.heading(ColorPickerState.color, color="white"),
            color_picker(
                on_change=ColorPickerState.set_color
            ),
        ),
        background_color=ColorPickerState.color,
        padding="5em",
        border_radius="1em",
    )
```

## What Not To Wrap

There are some libraries on npm that are not do not expose React components and therefore are very hard to wrap with Reflex. 

A library like [spline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@splinetool/runtime) below is going to be difficult to wrap with Reflex because it does not expose a React component.

```javascript
import \{ Application } from '@splinetool/runtime';

// make sure you have a canvas in the body
const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas3d');

// start the application and load the scene
const spline = new Application(canvas);
spline.load('https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode');
```

You should look out for JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript, which has angle brackets `(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>)`. If you see JSX, it's likely that the library is a React component and can be wrapped with Reflex. 

If the library does not expose a react component you need to try and find a JS React wrapper for the library, such as [react-spline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@splinetool/react-spline).

```javascript
import Spline from '@splinetool/react-spline';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Spline scene="https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode" />
    </div>
  );
}
```



In the next page, we will go step by step through a more complex example of wrapping a React component.


---
title: Serializers
---

# Serializers

Vars can be any type that can be serialized to JSON. This includes primitive types like strings, numbers, and booleans, as well as more complex types like lists, dictionaries, and dataframes.

In case you need to serialize a more complex type, you can use the `serializer` decorator to convert the type to a primitive type that can be stored in the state. Just define a method that takes the complex type as an argument and returns a primitive type. We use type annotations to determine the type that you want to serialize.

For example, the Plotly component serializes a plotly figure into a JSON string that can be stored in the state.

```python
import json
import reflex as rx
from plotly.graph_objects import Figure
from plotly.io import to_json

# Use the serializer decorator to convert the figure to a JSON string.
# Specify the type of the argument as an annotation.
@rx.serializer
def serialize_figure(figure: Figure) -> list:
    # Use Plotly's to_json method to convert the figure to a JSON string.
    return json.loads(to_json(figure))["data"]
```

We can then define a var of this type as a prop in our component.

```python
import reflex as rx
from plotly.graph_objects import Figure

class Plotly(rx.Component):
    """Display a plotly graph."""
    library = "react-plotly.js@2.6.0"
    lib_dependencies: List[str] = ["plotly.js@2.22.0"]

    tag = "Plot"

    is_default = True

    # Since a serialize is defined now, we can use the Figure type directly.
    data: rx.Var[Figure]
```


---
title: Library and Tags
---

```python exec
from pcweb.pages.docs import api_reference
```

# Find The Component

There are two ways to find a component to wrap:
1. Write the component yourself locally.
2. Find a well-maintained React library on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) that contains the component you need.

In both cases, the process of wrapping the component is the same except for the `library` field.

# Wrapping the Component

To start wrapping your React component, the first step is to create a new component in your Reflex app. This is done by creating a new class that inherits from `rx.Component` or `rx.NoSSRComponent`. 

See the [API Reference]({api_reference.component.path}) for more details on the `rx.Component` class.

This is when we will define the most important attributes of the component:
1. **library**: The name of the npm package that contains the component.
2. **tag**: The name of the component to import from the package.
3. **alias**: (Optional) The name of the alias to use for the component. This is useful if multiple component from different package have a name in common. If `alias` is not specified, `tag` will be used.
4. **lib_dependencies**: Any additional libraries needed to use the component.
5. **is_default**: (Optional) If the component is a default export from the module, set this to `True`. Default is `False`.

Optionally, you can override the default component creation behavior by implementing the `create` class method. Most components won't need this when props are straightforward conversions from Python to JavaScript. However, this is useful when you need to add custom initialization logic, transform props, or handle special cases when the component is created.

```md alert warning
# When setting the `library` attribute, it is recommended to included a pinned version of the package. Doing so, the package will only change when you intentionally update the version, avoid unexpected breaking changes.
```

```python
class MyBaseComponent(rx.Component):
    """MyBaseComponent."""

    # The name of the npm package.
    library = "my-library@x.y.z"

    # The name of the component to use from the package.
    tag = "MyComponent"

    # Any additional libraries needed to use the component.
    lib_dependencies: list[str] = ["package-deps@x.y.z"]

    # The name of the alias to use for the component.
    alias = "MyComponentAlias"

    # If the component is a default export from the module, set this to True.
    is_default = True/False

    @classmethod
    def create(cls, *children, **props):
        """Create an instance of MyBaseComponent.
        
        Args:
            *children: The children of the component.
            **props: The props of the component.
            
        Returns:
            The component instance.
        """
        # Your custom creation logic here
        return super().create(*children, **props)

```

# Wrapping a Dynamic Component 

When wrapping some libraries, you may want to use dynamic imports. This is because they may not be compatible with Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

To handle this in Reflex, subclass `NoSSRComponent` when defining your component. It works the same as `rx.Component`, but it will automatically add the correct custom code for a dynamic import.

Often times when you see an import something like this:

```javascript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const MyLibraryComponent = dynamic(() => import('./MyLibraryComponent'), {
  ssr: false
});
```

You can wrap it in Reflex like this:

```python
from reflex.components.component import NoSSRComponent

class MyLibraryComponent(NoSSRComponent):
    """A component that wraps a lib needing dynamic import."""

    library = "my-library@x.y.z"

    tag="MyLibraryComponent"
```

It may not always be clear when a library requires dynamic imports. A few things to keep in mind are if the component is very client side heavy i.e. the view and structure depends on things that are fetched at run time, or if it uses `window` or `document` objects directly it will need to be wrapped as a `NoSSRComponent`. 

Some examples are:

1. Video and Audio Players
2. Maps
3. Drawing Canvas
4. 3D Graphics
5. QR Scanners
6. Reactflow

The reason for this is that it does not make sense for your server to render these components as the server does not have access to your camera, it cannot draw on your canvas or render a video from a file. 

In addition, if in the component documentation it mentions nextJS compatibility or server side rendering compatibility, it is a good sign that it requires dynamic imports.

# Advanced - Parsing a state Var with a JS Function
When wrapping a component, you may need to parse a state var by applying a JS function to it. 

## Define the parsing function

First you need to define the parsing function by writing it in `add_custom_code`.

```python

def add_custom_code(self) -> list[str]:
    """Add custom code to the component."""
    # Define the parsing function
    return [
        """
        function myParsingFunction(inputProp) {
            // Your parsing logic here
            return parsedProp;
        }"""
    ]
```

## Apply the parsing function to your props

Then, you can apply the parsing function to your props in the `create` method. 

```python
from reflex.vars.base import Var
from reflex.vars.function import FunctionStringVar

    ...
    @classmethod
    def create(cls, *children, **props):
        """Create an instance of MyBaseComponent.
        
        Args:
            *children: The children of the component.
            **props: The props of the component.
            
        Returns:
            The component instance.
        """
        # Apply the parsing function to the props
        if (prop_to_parse := props.get("propsToParse")) is not None:
            if isinstance(prop_to_parse, Var):
                props["propsToParse"] = FunctionStringVar.create("myParsingFunction").call(prop_to_parse)
            else:
                # This is not a state Var, so you can parse the value directly in python
                parsed_prop = python_parsing_function(prop_to_parse)
                props["propsToParse"] = parsed_prop
        return super().create(*children, **props)
    ...
```




# Styles and Imports

When wrapping a React component, you may need to define styles and imports that are specific to the component. This is done by defining the `add_styles` and `add_imports` methods in your component class.

### Imports

Sometimes, the component you are wrapping will need to import other components or libraries. This is done by defining the `add_imports` method in your component class.
That method should return a dictionary of imports, where the keys are the names of the packages to import and the values are the names of the components or libraries to import.

Values can be either a string or a list of strings. If the import needs to be aliased, you can use the `ImportVar` object to specify the alias and whether the import should be installed as a dependency.

```python
from reflex.utils.imports import ImportVar

class ComponentWithImports(MyBaseComponent):
    def add_imports(self):
        """Add imports to the component."""
        return {
            # If you only have one import, you can use a string.
            "my-package1": "my-import1",
            # If you have multiple imports, you can pass a list.
            "my-package2": ["my-import2"],
            # If you need to control the import in a more detailed way, you can use an ImportVar object.
            "my-package3": ImportVar(tag="my-import3", alias="my-alias", install=False, is_default=False),
            # To import a CSS file, pass the full path to the file, and use an empty string as the key.
            "": "my-package-with-css/styles.css",
        }
```

```md alert info
# The tag and library of the component will be automatically added to the imports. They do not need to be added again in `add_imports`.
```

### Styles

Styles are any CSS styles that need to be included in the component. The style will be added inline to the component, so you can use any CSS styles that are valid in React.

```python
class StyledComponent(MyBaseComponent):
    """MyComponent."""

    def add_style(self) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
        """Add styles to the component."""

        return rx.Style({
            "backgroundColor": "red",
            "color": "white",
            "padding": "10px",
        })
```


# More React Libraries 


## AG Charts

Here we wrap the AG Charts library from the NPM package [ag-charts-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ag-charts-react). 

In the react code below we can see the first `2` lines are importing React and ReactDOM, and this can be ignored when wrapping your component.

We import the `AgCharts` component from the `ag-charts-react` library on line 5. In Reflex this is wrapped by `library = "ag-charts-react"` and `tag = "AgCharts"`.

Line `7` defines a functional React component, which on line `26` returns `AgCharts` which is similar in the Reflex code to using the `chart` component.

Line `9` uses the `useState` hook to create a state variable `chartOptions` and its setter function `setChartOptions` (equivalent to the event handler `set_chart_options` in reflex). The initial state variable is of type dict and has two key value pairs `data` and `series`. 

When we see `useState` in React code, it correlates to state variables in your State. As you can see in our Reflex code we have a state variable `chart_options` which is a dictionary, like in our React code.

Moving to line `26` we see that the `AgCharts` has a prop `options`. In order to use this in Reflex we must wrap this prop. We do this with `options: rx.Var[dict]` in the `AgCharts` component. 

Lines `31` and `32` are rendering the component inside the root element. This can be ignored when we are wrapping a component as it is done in Reflex by creating an `index` function and adding it to the app.

## React Leaflet

```python exec
from pcweb.pages import docs
```

In this example we are wrapping the React Leaflet library from the NPM package [react-leaflet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-leaflet).

On line `1` we import the `dynamic` function from Next.js and on line `21` we set `ssr: false`. Lines `4` and `6` use the `dynamic` function to import the `MapContainer` and `TileLayer` components from the `react-leaflet` library. This is used to dynamically import the `MapContainer` and `TileLayer` components from the `react-leaflet` library. This is done in Reflex by using the `NoSSRComponent` class when defining the component. There is more information of when this is needed on the `Dynamic Imports` section of this [page]({docs.wrapping_react.library_and_tags.path}).

It mentions in the documentation that it is necessary to include the Leaflet CSS file, which is added on line `2` in the React code below. This can be done in Reflex by using the `add_imports` method in the `MapContainer` component. We can add a relative path from within the React library or a full URL to the CSS file.

Line `4` defines a functional React component, which on line `8` returns the `MapContainer` which is done in the Reflex code using the `map_container` component.

The `MapContainer` component has props `center`, `zoom`, `scrollWheelZoom`, which we wrap in the `MapContainer` component in the Reflex code. We ignore the `style` prop as it is a reserved name in Reflex. We can use the `rename_props` method to change the name of the prop, as we will see in the React PDF Renderer example, but in this case we just ignore it and add the `width` and `height` props as css in Reflex.

The `TileLayer` component has a prop `url` which we wrap in the `TileLayer` component in the Reflex code.

Lines `24` and `25` defines and exports a React functional component named `Home` which returns the `MapComponent` component. This can be ignored in the Reflex code when wrapping the component as we return the `map_container` component in the `index` function.

## React PDF Renderer

In this example we are wrapping the React renderer for creating PDF files on the browser and server from the NPM package [@react-pdf/renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-pdf/renderer).

This example is similar to the previous examples, and again Dynamic Imports are required for this library. This is done in Reflex by using the `NoSSRComponent` class when defining the component. There is more information on why this is needed on the `Dynamic Imports` section of this [page]({docs.wrapping_react.library_and_tags.path}).

The main difference with this example is that the `style` prop, used on lines `20`, `21` and `24` in React code, is a reserved name in Reflex so can not be wrapped. A different name must be used when wrapping this prop and then this name must be changed back to the original with the `rename_props` method. In this example we name the prop `theme` in our Reflex code and then change it back to `style` with the `rename_props` method in both the `Page` and `View` components.


```md alert info

# Assets

Static files such as images and stylesheets can be placed in `assets/` folder of the project. These files can be referenced within your app.

```md alert
# Assets are copied during the build process.

Any files placed within the `assets/` folder at runtime will not be available to the app
when running in production mode. The `assets/` folder should only be used for static files.
```

## Referencing Assets

There are two ways to reference assets in your Reflex app:

### 1. Direct Path Reference

To reference an image in the `assets/` folder, pass the relative path as a prop.

For example, you can store your logo in your assets folder:

```bash
assets
└── Reflex.svg
```

Then you can display it using a `rx.image` component:

```python demo
rx.image(src="/Reflex.svg", width="5em")
```

```md alert
# Always prefix the asset path with a forward slash `/` to reference the asset from the root of the project, or it may not display correctly on non-root pages.
```

### 2. Using rx.asset Function

The `rx.asset` function provides a more flexible way to reference assets in your app. It supports both local assets (in the app's `assets/` directory) and shared assets (placed next to your Python files).

#### Local Assets

Local assets are stored in the app's `assets/` directory and are referenced using `rx.asset`:

```python demo
rx.image(src=rx.asset("Reflex.svg"), width="5em")
```

#### Shared Assets

Shared assets are placed next to your Python file and are linked to the app's external assets directory. This is useful for creating reusable components with their own assets:

```python box
# my_component.py
import reflex as rx

# my_script.js is located in the same directory as this Python file
def my_component():
    return rx.box(
        rx.script(src=rx.asset("my_script.js", shared=True)),
        "Component with custom script"
    )
```

You can also specify a subfolder for shared assets:

```python box
# my_component.py
import reflex as rx

# image.png is located in a subfolder next to this Python file
def my_component_with_image():
    return rx.image(
        src=rx.asset("image.png", shared=True, subfolder="images")
    )
```

```md alert
# Shared assets are linked to your app via symlinks.

When using `shared=True`, the asset is symlinked from its original location to your app's external assets directory. This allows you to keep assets alongside their related code.
```

## Favicon

The favicon is the small icon that appears in the browser tab.

You can add a `favicon.ico` file to the `assets/` folder to change the favicon.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import library
from pcweb.pages.docs import api_reference
from pcweb.styles.styles import get_code_style
from pcweb.styles.colors import c_color
```

# Files

In addition to any assets you ship with your app, many web app will often need to receive or send files, whether you want to share media, allow user to import their data, or export some backend data.

In this section, we will cover all you need to know for manipulating files in Reflex.

## Assets vs Upload Directory

Before diving into file uploads and downloads, it's important to understand the difference between assets and the upload directory in Reflex:

```python eval
# Simple table comparing assets vs upload directory
rx.table.root(
    rx.table.header(
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Feature"),
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Assets"),
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Upload Directory"),
        ),
    ),
    rx.table.body(
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.cell(rx.text("Purpose", font_weight="bold")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.text("Static files included with your app (images, stylesheets, scripts)")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.text("Dynamic files uploaded by users during runtime")),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.cell(rx.text("Location", font_weight="bold")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.hstack(
                rx.code("assets/", style=get_code_style("violet")),
                rx.text(" folder or next to Python files (shared assets)"),
                spacing="2",
            )),
            rx.table.cell(rx.hstack(
                rx.code("uploaded_files/", style=get_code_style("violet")),
                rx.text(" directory (configurable)"),
                spacing="2",
            )),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.cell(rx.text("Access Method", font_weight="bold")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.hstack(
                rx.code("rx.asset()", style=get_code_style("violet")),
                rx.text(" or direct path reference"),
                spacing="2",
            )),
            rx.table.cell(rx.code("rx.get_upload_url()", style=get_code_style("violet"))),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.cell(rx.text("When to Use", font_weight="bold")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.text("For files that are part of your application's codebase")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.text("For files that users upload or generate through your application")),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.cell(rx.text("Availability", font_weight="bold")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.text("Available at compile time")),
            rx.table.cell(rx.text("Available at runtime")),
        ),
    ),
    width="100%",
)
```



For more information about assets, see the [Assets Overview](/docs/assets/overview/).

## Download

If you want to let the users of your app download files from your server to their computer, Reflex offer you two way.

### With a regular link

For some basic usage, simply providing the path to your resource in a `rx.link` will work, and clicking the link will download or display the resource.

```python demo
rx.link("Download", href="/reflex_banner.png")
```

### With `rx.download` event

Using the `rx.download` event will always prompt the browser to download the file, even if it could be displayed in the browser.

The `rx.download` event also allows the download to be triggered from another backend event handler.

```python demo
rx.button(
    "Download",
    on_click=rx.download(url="/reflex_banner.png"),
)
```

`rx.download` lets you specify a name for the file that will be downloaded, if you want it to be different from the name on the server side.

```python demo
rx.button(
    "Download and Rename",
    on_click=rx.download(
        url="/reflex_banner.png",
        filename="different_name_logo.png"
    ),
)
```

If the data to download is not already available at a known URL, pass the `data` directly to the `rx.download` event from the backend.

```python demo exec
import random

class DownloadState(rx.State):
    @rx.event
    def download_random_data(self):
        return rx.download(
            data=",".join([str(random.randint(0, 100)) for _ in range(10)]),
            filename="random_numbers.csv"
        )

def download_random_data_button():
    return rx.button(
        "Download random numbers",
        on_click=DownloadState.download_random_data
    )
```

The `data` arg accepts `str` or `bytes` data, a `data:` URI, `PIL.Image`, or any state Var. If the Var is not already a string, it will be converted to a string using `JSON.stringify`. This allows complex state structures to be offered as JSON downloads.

Reference page for `rx.download` [here]({api_reference.special_events.path}#rx.download).

## Upload

Uploading files to your server let your users interact with your app in a different way than just filling forms to provide data.

The component `rx.upload` let your users upload files on the server.

Here is a basic example of how it is used:

```python
def index():
    return rx.fragment(
        rx.upload(rx.text("Upload files"), rx.icon(tag="upload")),
        rx.button(on_submit=State.<your_upload_handler>)
    )
```

For detailed information, see the reference page of the component [here]({library.forms.upload.path}).


```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# API Transformer

In addition to your frontend app, Reflex uses a FastAPI backend to serve your app. The API transformer feature allows you to transform or extend the ASGI app that serves your Reflex application.

## Overview

The API transformer provides a way to:

1. Integrate existing FastAPI or Starlette applications with your Reflex app
2. Apply middleware or transformations to the ASGI app
3. Extend your Reflex app with additional API endpoints

This is useful for creating a backend API that can be used for purposes beyond your Reflex app, or for integrating Reflex with existing backend services.

## Using API Transformer

You can set the `api_transformer` parameter when initializing your Reflex app:

```python
import reflex as rx
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer

# Create a FastAPI app
fastapi_app = FastAPI(title="My API")

# Add routes to the FastAPI app
@fastapi_app.get("/api/items")
async def get_items():
    return dict(items=["Item1", "Item2", "Item3"])

# Create a Reflex app with the FastAPI app as the API transformer
app = rx.App(api_transformer=fastapi_app)
```

## Types of API Transformers

The `api_transformer` parameter can accept:

1. A Starlette or FastAPI instance
2. A callable that takes an ASGIApp and returns an ASGIApp
3. A sequence of the above

### Using a FastAPI or Starlette Instance

When you provide a FastAPI or Starlette instance as the API transformer, Reflex will mount its internal API to your app, allowing you to define additional routes:

```python
import reflex as rx
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer

# Create a FastAPI app with authentication
fastapi_app = FastAPI(title="Secure API")
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

# Add a protected route
@fastapi_app.get("/api/protected")
async def protected_route(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    return dict(message="This is a protected endpoint")

# Create a token endpoint
@fastapi_app.post("/token")
async def login(username: str, password: str):
    # In a real app, you would validate credentials
    if username == "user" and password == "password":
        return dict(access_token="example_token", token_type="bearer")
    return dict(error="Invalid credentials")

# Create a Reflex app with the FastAPI app as the API transformer
app = rx.App(api_transformer=fastapi_app)
```

### Using a Callable Transformer

You can also provide a callable that transforms the ASGI app:

```python
import reflex as rx
from starlette.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

# Create a transformer function that returns a transformed ASGI app
def add_cors_middleware(app):
    # Wrap the app with CORS middleware and return the wrapped app
    return CORSMiddleware(
        app=app,
        allow_origins=["https://example.com"],
        allow_methods=["*"],
        allow_headers=["*"],
    )

# Create a Reflex app with the transformer
app = rx.App(api_transformer=add_cors_middleware)
```

### Using Multiple Transformers

You can apply multiple transformers by providing a sequence:

```python
import reflex as rx
from fastapi import FastAPI
from starlette.middleware import Middleware
from starlette.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

# Create a FastAPI app
fastapi_app = FastAPI(title="My API")

# Add routes to the FastAPI app
@fastapi_app.get("/api/items")
async def get_items():
    return dict(items=["Item1", "Item2", "Item3"])

# Create a transformer function
def add_logging_middleware(app):
    # This is a simple example middleware that logs requests
    async def middleware(scope, receive, send):
        # Log the request path
        path = scope["path"]
        print("Request:", path)
        await app(scope, receive, send)
    return middleware

# Create a Reflex app with multiple transformers
app = rx.App(api_transformer=[fastapi_app, add_logging_middleware])
```

## Reserved Routes

Some routes on the backend are reserved for the runtime of Reflex, and should not be overridden unless you know what you are doing.

### Ping

`localhost:8000/ping/`: You can use this route to check the health of the backend.

The expected return is `"pong"`.

### Event

`localhost:8000/_event`: the frontend will use this route to notify the backend that an event occurred.

```md alert error
# Overriding this route will break the event communication
```

### Upload

`localhost:8000/_upload`: This route is used for the upload of file when using `rx.upload()`.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs.library import library
from pcweb.pages import docs
```

# Props

Props modify the behavior and appearance of a component. They are passed in as keyword arguments to a component.

## Component Props

There are props that are shared between all components, but each component can also define its own props.

For example, the `rx.image` component has a `src` prop that specifies the URL of the image to display and an `alt` prop that specifies the alternate text for the image.

```python demo
rx.image(
    src="https://reflex.dev/logo.jpg",
    alt="Reflex Logo",
)
```

Check the docs for the component you are using to see what props are available and how they affect the component (see the `rx.image` [reference]({docs.library.media.image.path}#api-reference) page for example).


## Common Props

Components support many standard HTML properties as props. For example: the HTML [id]({"https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_id.asp"}) property is exposed directly as the prop `id`. The HTML [className]({"https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_classname.asp"}) property is exposed as the prop `class_name` (note the Pythonic snake_casing!).

```python demo
rx.box(
    "Hello World",
    id="box-id",
    class_name=["class-name-1", "class-name-2",],
)
```

In the example above, the `class_name` prop of the `rx.box` component is assigned a list of class names. This means the `rx.box` component will be styled with the CSS classes `class-name-1` and `class-name-2`.

## Style Props

In addition to component-specific props, most built-in components support a full range of style props. You can use any [CSS property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php) to style a component.

```python demo
rx.button(
    "Fancy Button",
    border_radius="1em",
    box_shadow="rgba(151, 65, 252, 0.8) 0 15px 30px -10px",
    background_image="linear-gradient(144deg,#AF40FF,#5B42F3 50%,#00DDEB)",
    box_sizing="border-box",
    color="white",
    opacity= 1,
)
```

See the [styling docs]({docs.styling.overview.path}) to learn more about customizing the appearance of your app.


## Binding Props to State

```md alert warning
# Optional: Learn all about [State]({docs.state.overview.path}) first.
```

Reflex apps define [State]({docs.state.overview.path}) classes that hold variables that can change over time.

State may be modified in response to things like user input like clicking a button, or in response to events like loading a page.

State vars can be bound to component props, so that the UI always reflects the current state of the app.

Try clicking the badge below to change its color.

```python demo exec
class PropExampleState(rx.State):
    text: str = "Hello World"
    color: str = "red"

    @rx.event
    def flip_color(self):
        if self.color == "red":
            self.color = "blue"
        else:
            self.color = "red"


def index():
    return rx.button(
        PropExampleState.text,
        color_scheme=PropExampleState.color,
        on_click=PropExampleState.flip_color,
    )
```

In this example, the `color_scheme` prop is bound to the `color` state var.

When the `flip_color` event handler is called, the `color` var is updated, and the `color_scheme` prop is updated to match.


```python exec
import reflex as rx

from pcweb.pages.docs import library
from pcweb.pages import docs
```

# Conditional Rendering

Recall from the [basics]({docs.getting_started.basics.path}) that we cannot use Python `if/else` statements when referencing state vars in Reflex. Instead, use the `rx.cond` component to conditionally render components or set props based on the value of a state var.

```md video https://youtube.com/embed/ITOZkzjtjUA?start=6040&end=6463
# Video: Conditional Rendering
```

```md alert
# Check out the API reference for [cond docs]({library.dynamic_rendering.cond.path}).
```

```python eval
rx.box(height="2em")
```

Below is a simple example showing how to toggle between two text components by checking the value of the state var `show`.

```python demo exec
class CondSimpleState(rx.State):
    show: bool = True

    @rx.event
    def change(self):
        self.show = not (self.show)


def cond_simple_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.button("Toggle", on_click=CondSimpleState.change),
        rx.cond(
            CondSimpleState.show,
            rx.text("Text 1", color="blue"),
            rx.text("Text 2", color="red"),
        ),
    )
```

If `show` is `True` then the first component is rendered (in this case the blue text). Otherwise the second component is rendered (in this case the red text).

## Conditional Props

You can also set props conditionally using `rx.cond`. In this example, we set the `color` prop of a text component based on the value of the state var `show`.

```python demo exec
class PropCondState(rx.State):

    value: int

    @rx.event
    def set_end(self, value: list[int | float]):
        self.value = value[0]


def cond_prop():
    return rx.slider(
        default_value=[50],
        on_value_commit=PropCondState.set_end,
        color_scheme=rx.cond(PropCondState.value > 50, "green", "pink"),
        width="100%",
    )
```


## Var Operations

You can use [var operations]({docs.vars.var_operations.path}) with the `cond` component for more complex conditions. See the full [cond reference]({library.dynamic_rendering.cond.path}) for more details.


## Multiple Conditional Statements

The [`rx.match`]({library.dynamic_rendering.match.path}) component in Reflex provides a powerful alternative to`rx.cond` for handling multiple conditional statements and structural pattern matching. This component allows you to handle multiple conditions and their associated components in a cleaner and more readable way compared to nested `rx.cond` structures.

```python demo exec
from typing import List

import reflex as rx


class MatchState(rx.State):
    cat_breed: str = ""
    animal_options: List[str] = [
        "persian",
        "siamese",
        "maine coon",
        "ragdoll",
        "pug",
        "corgi",
    ]

    @rx.event
    def set_cat_breed(self, breed: str):
        self.cat_breed = breed


def match_demo():
    return rx.flex(
        rx.match(
            MatchState.cat_breed,
            ("persian", rx.text("Persian cat selected.")),
            ("siamese", rx.text("Siamese cat selected.")),
            (
                "maine coon",
                rx.text("Maine Coon cat selected."),
            ),
            ("ragdoll", rx.text("Ragdoll cat selected.")),
            rx.text("Unknown cat breed selected."),
        ),
        rx.select(
            [
                "persian",
                "siamese",
                "maine coon",
                "ragdoll",
                "pug",
                "corgi",
            ],
            value=MatchState.cat_breed,
            on_change=MatchState.set_cat_breed,
        ),
        direction="column",
        gap="2",
    )
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx

from pcweb.pages import docs
```

# Rendering Iterables

Recall again from the [basics]({docs.getting_started.basics.path}) that we cannot use Python `for` loops when referencing state vars in Reflex. Instead, use the `rx.foreach` component to render components from a collection of data.

For dynamic content that should automatically scroll to show the newest items, consider using the [auto scroll]({docs.library.dynamic_rendering.auto_scroll.path}) component together with `rx.foreach`.

```python demo exec
class IterState(rx.State):
    color: list[str] = [
        "red",
        "green",
        "blue",
    ]


def colored_box(color: str):
    return rx.button(color, background_color=color)


def dynamic_buttons():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.foreach(IterState.color, colored_box),
    )

```

Here's the same example using a lambda function.

```python
def dynamic_buttons():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.foreach(IterState.color, lambda color: colored_box(color)),
    )
```

You can also use lambda functions directly with components without defining a separate function.

```python
def dynamic_buttons():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.foreach(IterState.color, lambda color: rx.button(color, background_color=color)),
    )
```

In this first simple example we iterate through a `list` of colors and render a dynamic number of buttons.

The first argument of the `rx.foreach` function is the state var that you want to iterate through. The second argument is a function that takes in an item from the data and returns a component. In this case, the `colored_box` function takes in a color and returns a button with that color.

## For vs Foreach

```md definition
# Regular For Loop
* Use when iterating over constants.

# Foreach
* Use when iterating over state vars.
```

The above example could have been written using a regular Python `for` loop, since the data is constant.

```python demo exec
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
def dynamic_buttons_for():
    return rx.vstack(
        [colored_box(color) for color in colors],
    )
```

However, as soon as you need the data to be dynamic, you must use `rx.foreach`.

```python demo exec
class DynamicIterState(rx.State):
    color: list[str] = [
        "red",
        "green",
        "blue",
    ]

    def add_color(self, form_data):
        self.color.append(form_data["color"])

def dynamic_buttons_foreach():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.foreach(DynamicIterState.color, colored_box),
        rx.form(
            rx.input(name="color", placeholder="Add a color"),
            rx.button("Add"),
            on_submit=DynamicIterState.add_color,
        )
    )
```

## Render Function

The function to render each item can be defined either as a separate function or as a lambda function. In the example below, we define the function `colored_box` separately and pass it to the `rx.foreach` function. 

```python demo exec
class IterState2(rx.State):
    color: list[str] = [
        "red",
        "green",
        "blue",
    ]

def colored_box(color: rx.Var[str]):
    return rx.button(color, background_color=color)

def dynamic_buttons2():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.foreach(IterState2.color, colored_box),
    )

```

Notice that the type annotation for the `color` parameter in the `colored_box` function is `rx.Var[str]` (rather than just `str`). This is because the `rx.foreach` function passes the item as a `Var` object, which is a wrapper around the actual value. This is what allows us to compile the frontend without knowing the actual value of the state var (which is only known at runtime).

## Enumerating Iterables

The function can also take an index as a second argument, meaning that we can enumerate through data as shown in the example below.

```python demo exec
class IterIndexState(rx.State):
    color: list[str] = [
        "red",
        "green",
        "blue",
    ]


def create_button(color: rx.Var[str], index: int):
    return rx.box(
        rx.button(f"{index + 1}. {color}"),
        padding_y="0.5em",
    )

def enumerate_foreach():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.foreach(
            IterIndexState.color,
            create_button
        ),
    )
```

Here's the same example using a lambda function.

```python
def enumerate_foreach():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.foreach(
            IterIndexState.color,
            lambda color, index: create_button(color, index)
        ),
    )
```

## Iterating Dictionaries

We can iterate through a `dict` using a `foreach`. When the dict is passed through to the function that renders each item, it is presented as a list of key-value pairs `[("sky", "blue"), ("balloon", "red"), ("grass", "green")]`.

```python demo exec
class SimpleDictIterState(rx.State):
    color_chart: dict[str, str] = {
        "sky": "blue",
        "balloon": "red",
        "grass": "green",
    }


def display_color(color: list):
    # color is presented as a list key-value pairs [("sky", "blue"), ("balloon", "red"), ("grass", "green")]
    return rx.box(rx.text(color[0]), bg=color[1], padding_x="1.5em")


def dict_foreach():
    return rx.grid(
        rx.foreach(
            SimpleDictIterState.color_chart,
            display_color,
        ),
        columns="3",
    )

```

```md alert warning
# Dict Type Annotation.
It is essential to provide the correct full type annotation for the dictionary in the state definition (e.g., `dict[str, str]` instead of `dict`) to ensure `rx.foreach` works as expected. Proper typing allows Reflex to infer and validate the structure of the data during rendering.
```

## Nested examples

`rx.foreach` can be used with nested state vars. Here we use nested `foreach` components to render the nested state vars. The `rx.foreach(project["technologies"], get_badge)` inside of the `project_item` function, renders the `dict` values which are of type `list`. The `rx.box(rx.foreach(NestedStateFE.projects, project_item))` inside of the `projects_example` function renders each `dict` inside of the overall state var `projects`.

```python demo exec
class NestedStateFE(rx.State):
    projects: list[dict[str, list]] = [
        {
            "technologies": ["Next.js", "Prisma", "Tailwind", "Google Cloud", "Docker", "MySQL"]
        },
        {
            "technologies": ["Python", "Flask", "Google Cloud", "Docker"]
        }
    ]

def get_badge(technology: rx.Var[str]) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.badge(technology, variant="soft", color_scheme="green")

def project_item(project: rx.Var[dict[str, list]]) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.box(
        rx.hstack(            
            rx.foreach(project["technologies"], get_badge)
        ),
    )

def projects_example() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.box(rx.foreach(NestedStateFE.projects, project_item))
```

If you want an example where not all of the values in the dict are the same type then check out the example on [var operations using foreach]({docs.vars.var_operations.path}).

Here is a further example of how to use `foreach` with a nested data structure.

```python demo exec
class NestedDictIterState(rx.State):
    color_chart: dict[str, list[str]] = {
        "purple": ["red", "blue"],
        "orange": ["yellow", "red"],
        "green": ["blue", "yellow"],
    }


def display_colors(color: rx.Var[tuple[str, list[str]]]):
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text(color[0], color=color[0]),
        rx.hstack(
            rx.foreach(
                color[1],
                lambda x: rx.box(
                    rx.text(x, color="black"), bg=x
                ),
            )
        ),
    )


def nested_dict_foreach():
    return rx.grid(
        rx.foreach(
            NestedDictIterState.color_chart,
            display_colors,
        ),
        columns="3",
    )

```

## Foreach with Cond

We can also use `foreach` with the `cond` component.

In this example we define the function `render_item`. This function takes in an `item`, uses the `cond` to check if the item `is_packed`. If it is packed it returns the `item_name` with a `✔` next to it, and if not then it just returns the `item_name`. We use the `foreach` to iterate over all of the items in the `to_do_list` using the `render_item` function.

```python demo exec
import dataclasses

@dataclasses.dataclass
class ToDoListItem:
    item_name: str
    is_packed: bool

class ForeachCondState(rx.State):
    to_do_list: list[ToDoListItem] = [
        ToDoListItem(item_name="Space suit", is_packed=True), 
        ToDoListItem(item_name="Helmet", is_packed=True),
        ToDoListItem(item_name="Back Pack", is_packed=False),
        ]


def render_item(item: rx.Var[ToDoListItem]):
    return rx.cond(
        item.is_packed, 
        rx.list.item(item.item_name + ' ✔'),
        rx.list.item(item.item_name),
    )

def packing_list():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text("Sammy's Packing List"),
        rx.list(rx.foreach(ForeachCondState.to_do_list, render_item)),
    )

```

```

# Drag and Drop

Reflex Enterprise provides comprehensive drag and drop functionality for creating interactive UI elements using the `rxe.dnd` module. Built on top of react-dnd, it offers both high-level components for common use cases and low-level hooks for advanced scenarios.

```md alert warning
# Important: Always decorate functions defining `rxe.dnd.draggable` components with `@rx.memo` to avoid compilation errors.
```

## Basic Usage

### Simple Drag and Drop

Here's a basic example showing how to create a draggable item and drop target:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

class BasicDndState(rx.State):
    drop_count: int = 0

    def increment_drop_count(self):
        self.drop_count += 1


@rx.memo
def draggable_card():
    return rxe.dnd.draggable(
        rx.card(
            rx.text("Drag me!", weight="bold"),
            rx.text("I can be moved around"),
            bg="blue.500",
            color="white",
            p=4,
            cursor="grab",
            width="200px",
            height="100px"
        ),
        type="BasicCard",
        item={"message": "Hello from draggable!"},
    )

def basic_drag_drop():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text(f"Items dropped: {BasicDndState.drop_count}"),
        rx.hstack(
            draggable_card(),
            rxe.dnd.drop_target(
                rx.box(
                    "Drop Zone",
                    bg="gray.100",
                    border="2px dashed gray",
                    min_height="150px",
                    min_width="200px",
                    display="flex",
                    align_items="center",
                    justify_content="center",
                    font_weight="bold"
                ),
                accept=["BasicCard"],
                on_drop=BasicDndState.increment_drop_count,
            ),
            spacing="4",
            align="start"
        ),
        spacing="4"
    )
```

### Multi-Position Drag and Drop

Create a draggable item that can be moved between multiple drop targets:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

class MultiPositionState(rx.State):
    card_position: int = 0

    def set_card_position(self, position: int):
        self.card_position = position


@rx.memo
def movable_card():
    return rxe.dnd.draggable(
        rx.card(
            rx.text("Movable Card", weight="bold"),
            rx.text("Position: " + MultiPositionState.card_position.to_string()),
            bg="purple.500",
            color="white",
            p=4,
            width="180px",
            height="120px"
        ),
        type="MovableCard",
        border="2px solid purple",
    )

def drop_zone(position: int):
    params = rxe.dnd.DropTarget.collected_params
    return rxe.dnd.drop_target(
        rx.cond(
            MultiPositionState.card_position == position,
            movable_card(),
            rx.box(
                f"Drop Zone {position}",
                color="gray.600",
                font_weight="bold"
            )
        ),
        width="200px",
        height="200px",
        border="2px solid red",
        border_color=rx.cond(params.is_over, "green.500", "red.500"),
        bg=rx.cond(params.is_over, "green.100", "blue.100"),
        accept=["MovableCard"],
        on_drop=lambda _: MultiPositionState.set_card_position(position),
        display="flex",
        align_items="center",
        justify_content="center"
    )

def multi_position_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text("Drag the card between positions", weight="bold"),
        rx.grid(
            drop_zone(0),
            drop_zone(1),
            drop_zone(2),
            drop_zone(3),
            columns="2",
            spacing="4"
        ),
        spacing="4"
    )
```

## Advanced Features

### State Tracking with Collected Parameters

Access drag and drop state information using collected parameters:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

class StateTrackingState(rx.State):
    drag_info: str = "No drag activity"

    def set_drag_info(self, value: str):
        self.drag_info = value

@rx.memo
def tracked_draggable():
    drag_params = rxe.dnd.Draggable.collected_params
    return rxe.dnd.draggable(
        rx.card(
            rx.text("Tracked Draggable"),
            rx.text(rx.cond(drag_params.is_dragging, "Dragging...", "Ready to drag")),
            bg=rx.cond(drag_params.is_dragging, "orange.500", "blue.500"),
            color="white",
            p=4,
            opacity=rx.cond(drag_params.is_dragging, 0.5, 1.0)
        ),
        type="TrackedItem",
        on_end=StateTrackingState.set_drag_info("Drag ended")
    )

def tracked_drop_target():
    drop_params = rxe.dnd.DropTarget.collected_params
    return rxe.dnd.drop_target(
        rx.box(
            rx.text("Smart Drop Zone"),
            rx.text(rx.cond(drop_params.is_over, "Ready to receive!", "Waiting...")),
            bg=rx.cond(drop_params.is_over, "green.200", "gray.100"),
            border=rx.cond(drop_params.is_over, "2px solid green", "2px dashed gray"),
            p=4,
            min_height="150px",
            display="flex",
            flex_direction="column",
            align_items="center",
            justify_content="center"
        ),
        accept=["TrackedItem"],
        on_drop=StateTrackingState.set_drag_info("Item successfully dropped!"),
        on_hover=StateTrackingState.set_drag_info("Item hovering over drop zone")
    )

def state_tracking_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text(f"Status: {StateTrackingState.drag_info}"),
        rx.hstack(
            tracked_draggable(),
            tracked_drop_target(),
            spacing="4"
        ),
        spacing="4"
    )
```

### Dynamic Lists with Drag and Drop

Create dynamic draggable lists using `rx.foreach`:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

class ListItem(rx.Base):
    id: str
    text: str
    list_id: str

class DynamicListState(rx.State):
    list_a: list[ListItem] = [
        ListItem(id="1", text="Item 1", list_id="A"),
        ListItem(id="2", text="Item 2", list_id="A"),
        ListItem(id="3", text="Item 3", list_id="A"),
    ]
    list_b: list[ListItem] = [
        ListItem(id="4", text="Item 4", list_id="B"),
        ListItem(id="5", text="Item 5", list_id="B"),
    ]

    def move_item(self, item_data: dict, target_list: str):
        item_id = item_data.get("id")
        source_list = item_data.get("list_id")

        if not item_id or not source_list:

## Core Components

### Draggable

The `rxe.dnd.draggable` component makes any element draggable:

**Key Properties:**
- `type`: String identifier for drag type matching
- `item`: Data object passed to drop handlers
- `on_end`: Called when drag operation ends

### Drop Target

The `rxe.dnd.drop_target` component creates areas that accept draggable items:

**Key Properties:**
- `accept`: List of drag types this target accepts
- `on_drop`: Called when item is dropped
- `on_hover`: Called when item hovers over target

### Collected Parameters

Access real-time drag/drop state:

**Draggable Parameters (`rxe.dnd.Draggable.collected_params`):**
- `is_dragging`: Boolean indicating if item is being dragged

**Drop Target Parameters (`rxe.dnd.DropTarget.collected_params`):**
- `is_over`: Boolean indicating if draggable is hovering
- `can_drop`: Boolean indicating if drop is allowed

# API Reference

### rxe.dnd.draggable

Creates a draggable component that can be moved around the interface.

**Parameters:**

- **`type`** (str, required): String identifier that must match the `accept` list of drop targets
- **`item`** (dict | Callable): Data object passed to drop handlers. Can be a static dictionary or a function that receives a `DragSourceMonitor` and returns data
- **`preview_options`** (dict): Configuration for the drag preview appearance
- **`options`** (dict): Additional drag source options like `dropEffect`
- **`on_end`** (EventHandler): Event handler called when drag operation completes
- **`can_drag`** (Callable): Function that determines if the item can be dragged
- **`is_dragging`** (Callable): Function to override the default dragging state detection
- **`collect`** (Callable): Function to collect custom properties from the drag monitor

### rxe.dnd.drop_target

Creates a drop target that can receive draggable items.

**Parameters:**

- **`accept`** (str | list[str], required): Drag type(s) this target accepts
- **`options`** (dict): Additional drop target configuration options
- **`on_drop`** (EventHandler): Event handler called when an item is dropped, receives the `item` data
- **`on_hover`** (EventHandler): Event handler called when an item hovers over the target
- **`can_drop`** (Callable): Function that determines if a specific item can be dropped
- **`collect`** (Callable): Function to collect custom properties from the drop monitor

## Monitor Classes

### DragSourceMonitor

Provides information about the drag operation state:

- **`is_dragging()`**: Returns `True` if this item is currently being dragged
- **`can_drag()`**: Returns `True` if the item can be dragged
- **`get_item()`**: Returns the item data being dragged
- **`get_item_type()`**: Returns the drag type string
- **`get_drop_result()`**: Returns the drop result (available in `on_end`)
- **`did_drop()`**: Returns `True` if the item was successfully dropped

### DropTargetMonitor

Provides information about the drop target state:

- **`is_over()`**: Returns `True` if a draggable item is hovering over this target
- **`can_drop()`**: Returns `True` if the hovering item can be dropped
- **`get_item()`**: Returns the item data of the hovering draggable
- **`get_item_type()`**: Returns the drag type of the hovering item

## Default Collected Parameters

### Draggable.collected_params

```python
{
    "is_dragging": bool,  # True when this item is being dragged
    "can_drag": bool      # True when this item can be dragged
}
```

### DropTarget.collected_params

```python
{
    "is_over": bool,           # True when a draggable is hovering
    "can_drop": bool,          # True when the hovering item can be dropped
    "item": dict | None        # Data from the hovering draggable item
}
```

## Advanced Usage Examples

### Data Passing with Item Parameter

The `item` parameter allows you to pass data from draggable components to drop handlers:

```python demo exec toggle
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

class SimpleState(rx.State):
    message: str = "No items dropped yet"

    def set_message_from_item(self, item: dict):
        self.message = f"Dropped: {item['name']}"

def simple_draggable():
    return rxe.dnd.draggable(
        rx.box(
            "Drag me!",
            p=4,
            bg="blue.100",
            border="1px solid blue",
            cursor="grab"
        ),
        type="simple",
        item={"name": "test_item", "value": 42}
    )

def simple_drop_target():
    return rxe.dnd.drop_target(
        rx.box(
            rx.text(SimpleState.message),
            p=4,
            bg="gray.100",
            border="2px dashed gray",
            min_height="100px"
        ),
        accept=["simple"],
        on_drop=SimpleState.set_message_from_item
    )

def item_data_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        simple_draggable(),
        simple_drop_target(),
        spacing="4"
    )
```

### Custom Collect Functions

The `collect` parameter allows you to access drag and drop state information in real-time:

```python demo exec toggle
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

class CollectState(rx.State):
    drag_info: str = "No drag activity"
    drop_info: str = "No drop activity"

    def handle_drop(self, item: dict):
        self.drop_info = f"Dropped: {item.get('name', 'Unknown')}"
        return rx.toast(f"Successfully dropped {item.get('name', 'item')}")



def collect_draggable():
    params = rxe.dnd.Draggable.collected_params
    return rxe.dnd.draggable(
        rx.box(
            rx.vstack(
                rx.text("Drag me!", weight="bold"),
                rx.text(f"Dragging: {params.is_dragging}", size="2"),
                rx.text(f"Can drag: {params.can_drag}", size="2"),
                spacing="1"
            ),
            p=4,
            bg=rx.cond(params.is_dragging, "blue.200", "blue.100"),
            border="1px solid blue",
            cursor=rx.cond(params.is_dragging, "grabbing", "grab"),
            opacity=rx.cond(params.is_dragging, 0.7, 1.0)
        ),
        type="collect_item",
        item={"id": "collect_test", "name": "Test Item"}
    )

def collect_drop_target():
    params = rxe.dnd.DropTarget.collected_params
    return rxe.dnd.drop_target(
        rx.box(
            rx.vstack(
                rx.text("Drop Zone", weight="bold"),
                rx.text(f"Is over: {params.is_over}", size="2"),
                rx.text(f"Can drop: {params.can_drop}", size="2"),
                rx.cond(
                    params.item,
                    rx.text(f"Hovering item: {params.item.get('name', 'Unknown')}", size="2"),
                    rx.text("No item hovering", size="2")
                ),
                spacing="1"
            ),
            p=4,
            bg=rx.cond(
                params.is_over & params.can_drop,
                "green.200",
                rx.cond(params.is_over, "yellow.200", "gray.100")
            ),
            border=rx.cond(
                params.is_over & params.can_drop,
                "2px solid green",
                rx.cond(params.is_over, "2px solid yellow", "2px dashed gray")
            ),
            min_height="120px"
        ),
        accept=["collect_item"],
        on_drop=CollectState.handle_drop,
    )

def custom_collect_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text("Real-time Monitor State", weight="bold", size="4"),
        rx.hstack(
            collect_draggable(),
            collect_drop_target(),
            spacing="6",
            align="start"
        ),
        rx.text(CollectState.drop_info, size="2", color="gray.600"),
        spacing="4"
    )
```

## Provider

Drag and drop functionality requires the `rxe.dnd.provider` component to wrap your app. The provider is automatically added when using `draggable` or `drop_target` components.

For manual control:

```python
def app():
    return rxe.dnd.provider(
        # Your app content
        your_app_content(),
        backend="HTML5"  # or "Touch" for mobile
    )
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use `@rx.memo`** on functions containing draggable components
2. **Use descriptive type names** for better debugging
3. **Handle edge cases** in drop handlers (invalid items, etc.)
4. **Provide visual feedback** using collected parameters
5. **Test on mobile devices** with touch backend
6. **Keep item data lightweight** for better performance

# Single Port Proxy

Enable single-port deployment by proxying the backend to the frontend port.

## Configuration

```python
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

config = rxe.Config(
    use_single_port=True,
)
```

This allows your application to run on a single port, which is useful for deployment scenarios where you can only expose one port.

# Reflex Enterprise

```python exec
from pcweb.pages.docs import enterprise
import reflex as rx
try:
    import reflex_enterprise as rxe
    from reflex_enterprise.components.ag_grid.resource import RendererParams
except ImportError:
    rxe = None
    RendererParams = None
```

Reflex Enterprise is a package containing paid features built on top of Reflex.

```md alert info
# Despite being an enterprise package, free users can use the components from this package. A badge "Built with Reflex" will be shown in the bottom right corner of the app.
For more information on the badge, visit [Built with Reflex]({enterprise.built_with_reflex.path}).
```

## Installation

`reflex-enterprise` must be installed alongside `reflex` to access the enterprise features.

You can install it from pypi with the following command:

```bash
pip install reflex-enterprise
```

## Usage of reflex_enterprise.

Using `rxe.App` as your `app` is required to use any of the components provided by the enterprise package, as well as config options provided by `rxe.Config`.

### In the main file

Instead of the usual `rx.App()` to create your app, use the following:
```python
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
app = rxe.App()
```

### In rxconfig.py
```python
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
config = rxe.Config(
    app_name="MyApp",
    ... # you can pass all rx.Config arguments as well as the one specific to rxe.Config
)
```

# Built with Reflex Badge

The "Built with Reflex" badge appears in the bottom right corner of apps using reflex-enterprise components.

## Removing the Badge

To remove the badge, you need to be on the Enterprise tier.

## Configuration

```python
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

config = rxe.Config(
    show_built_with_reflex=False,  # Requires paid tier
)
```

# Edges

Edges connect nodes together in a flow. This page explains how to define, customize, and interact with edges in Reflex Flow.

## The Edge Type

An edge is represented as a Python dictionary with the following fields:

- `id` (`str`) – Unique identifier for the edge.
- `source` (`str`) – ID of the source node.
- `target` (`str`) – ID of the target node.
- `type` (`str`) – Edge type defined in `edge_types`.
- `sourceHandle` (`str | None`) – Optional source handle ID.
- `targetHandle` (`str | None`) – Optional target handle ID.
- `animated` (`bool`) – Whether the edge should animate.
- `hidden` (`bool`) – Whether the edge is hidden.
- `deletable` (`bool`) – Whether the edge can be removed.
- `selectable` (`bool`) – Whether the edge can be selected.
- `data` (`dict`) – Arbitrary metadata.
- `label` (`Any`) – Label rendered along the edge.
- `style` (`dict`) – Custom styles.
- `className` (`str`) – CSS class for the edge.

## Basic Edge Types

Reflex Flow comes with several built-in edge types:

### Default Edge Types

```python
edges: list[Edge] = [
    {"id": "e1", "source": "1", "target": "2", "type": "default"},
    {"id": "e2", "source": "2", "target": "3", "type": "straight"},
    {"id": "e3", "source": "3", "target": "4", "type": "step"},
    {"id": "e4", "source": "4", "target": "5", "type": "smoothstep"},
    {"id": "e5", "source": "5", "target": "6", "type": "bezier"},
]
```

- **default** – Standard curved edge
- **straight** – Direct line between nodes
- **step** – Right-angled path with steps
- **smoothstep** – Smooth right-angled path
- **bezier** – Curved bezier path

## Edge Styling

### Basic Styling

Add visual styling to edges using the `style` property:

```python
edges: list[Edge] = [
    {
        "id": "styled-edge",
        "source": "1",
        "target": "2",
        "style": {
            "stroke": "#ff6b6b",
            "strokeWidth": 3,
        }
    }
]
```

### Animated Edges

Make edges animate with flowing dots:

```python
edges: list[Edge] = [
    {
        "id": "animated-edge",
        "source": "1",
        "target": "2",
        "animated": True,
        "style": {"stroke": "#4dabf7"}
    }
]
```

### Edge Labels

Add text labels to edges:

```python
edges: list[Edge] = [
    {
        "id": "labeled-edge",
        "source": "1",
        "target": "2",
        "label": "Connection",
        "style": {"stroke": "#51cf66"}
    }
]
```

# Custom Edges

React Flow in Reflex also allows you to define custom edge types. This is useful when you want edges to carry extra functionality (like buttons, labels, or dynamic styling) beyond the default straight or bezier connectors.

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
from reflex_enterprise.components.flow.types import (
    ConnectionInProgress,
    Edge,
    NoConnection,
    Node,
    Position,
)

class SimpleEdgeDemoState(rx.State):
    nodes: list[Node] = [
        {"id": "1", "position": {"x": 0, "y": 0}, "data": {"label": "Node A"}, "style": {"color": "#000000",}},
        {"id": "2", "position": {"x": 250, "y": 150}, "data": {"label": "Node B"}, "style": {"color": "#000000",}},
    ]
    edges: list[Edge] = [
        {"id": "e1-2", "source": "1", "target": "2", "type": "button"}
    ]

    @rx.event
    def set_nodes(self, nodes: list[Node]):
        self.nodes = nodes

    @rx.event
    def set_edges(self, edges: list[Edge]):
        self.edges = edges

    @rx.event
    def handle_connect_end(
        self,
        connection_status: NoConnection | ConnectionInProgress,
    ):
        if not connection_status["isValid"]:
            new_edge = {
                "id": f"{connection_status['fromNode']['id']}-{connection_status['toNode']['id']}",
                "source": connection_status["fromNode"]["id"],
                "target": connection_status["toNode"]["id"],
                "type": "button",
            }
            self.edges.append(new_edge)

# Basic Flow Example

This example demonstrates a simple flow diagram with three nodes and two edges, showing how nodes can be connected and how edges can be animated.

### Nodes

- Input Node – starting point
- Default Node – standard content node
- Output Node – endpoint of the flow

### Edges

- Input → Default (animated)
- Default → Output

### Interactivity

- Nodes can be moved
- Edges update dynamically
- Users can drag from handles to create new edges
- Zoom, pan, and mini-map controls are available

### Visual Layout

- Flow fits viewport automatically
- Background grid for orientation
- Light and dark color modes supported

### Example Flow

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

# Common style for all nodes
node_style = {

# Example React Flow Components

This section showcases examples of interactive flow components built with Reflex and Reflex Enterprise. Learn how to create dynamic nodes, edges, and custom behaviors for building flow diagrams in your React apps.

## Add Node on Edge Drop

In this example, we demonstrate how to dynamically add nodes to a flow when a connection is dropped onto the canvas. When the user drops a connection, a new node is created at the drop point, and an edge is added between the source node and the new node.


```python demo exec
import reflex as rx

import reflex_enterprise as rxe
from reflex_enterprise.components.flow.types import (
    ConnectionInProgress,
    Edge,
    NoConnection,
    Node,
    XYPosition,
)

node_style = {
    "color": "#000000",
}

initial_nodes: list[Node] = [
    {
        "id": "0",
        "type": "input",
        "data": {"label": "Node"},
        "position": {"x": 0, "y": 50},
        "style": node_style
    },
]


class AddNodesOnEdgeDropState(rx.State):
    nodes: rx.Field[list[Node]] = rx.field(default_factory=lambda: initial_nodes)
    edges: rx.Field[list[Edge]] = rx.field(default_factory=list)
    node_id: int = 1

    @rx.event
    def increment(self):
        self.node_id += 1

    @rx.event
    def set_nodes(self, nodes: list[Node]):
        self.nodes = nodes

    @rx.event
    def set_edges(self, edges: list[Edge]):

    ):
        if not connection_status["isValid"]:
            node_id = str(self.node_id)
            self.increment()
            self.nodes.append(

            )
            self.edges.append(
                {
                    "id": node_id,

## Connection Limit on Custom Node

This example demonstrates how to create a custom node with a connection limit on its handle. The handle can be configured to allow a specific number of connections, or no connections at all, using the isConnectable property. This is useful when you want to restrict the number of connections a node can have.

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx

import reflex_enterprise as rxe
from reflex_enterprise.components.flow.types import Edge, HandleType, Node, Position

node_style = {
    "color": "#000000",
}

                "style": node_style
            },
            {

# Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a flow. This page explains how to define and customize nodes in Reflex Flow.

## The Node Type

A node is represented as a Python dictionary with the following fields:

- `id` (`str`) – Unique identifier for the node.
- `position` (`dict`) – Position of the node with `x` and `y` coordinates.
- `data` (`dict`) – Arbitrary data passed to the node component.
- `type` (`str`) – Node type defined in `node_types`.
- `sourcePosition` (`str`) – Controls source handle position ("top", "right", "bottom", "left").
- `targetPosition` (`str`) – Controls target handle position ("top", "right", "bottom", "left").
- `hidden` (`bool`) – Whether the node is visible on the canvas.
- `selected` (`bool`) – Whether the node is currently selected.
- `draggable` (`bool`) – Whether the node can be dragged.
- `selectable` (`bool`) – Whether the node can be selected.
- `connectable` (`bool`) – Whether the node can be connected to other nodes.
- `deletable` (`bool`) – Whether the node can be deleted.
- `width` (`float`) – Width of the node.
- `height` (`float`) – Height of the node.
- `parentId` (`str`) – Parent node ID for creating sub-flows.
- `style` (`dict`) – Custom styles for the node.
- `className` (`str`) – CSS class name for the node.

## Built-in Node Types

Reflex Flow includes several built-in node types:

```python
nodes: list[Node] = [
    {"id": "1", "type": "input", "position": {"x": 100, "y": 100}, "data": {"label": "Start"}},
    {"id": "2", "type": "default", "position": {"x": 300, "y": 100}, "data": {"label": "Process"}},
    {"id": "3", "type": "output", "position": {"x": 500, "y": 100}, "data": {"label": "End"}},
]
```

- **input** – Entry point with only source handles
- **default** – Standard node with both source and target handles
- **output** – Exit point with only target handles

## Basic Node Configuration

### Node Positioning

```python
node = {
    "id": "positioned-node",
    "type": "default",
    "position": {"x": 250, "y": 150},
    "data": {"label": "Positioned Node"}
}
```

### Node Styling

```python
styled_node = {
    "id": "styled-node",
    "type": "default",
    "position": {"x": 100, "y": 200},
    "data": {"label": "Custom Style"},
    "style": {
        "background": "#ff6b6b",
        "color": "white",
        "border": "2px solid #ff5252",
        "borderRadius": "8px",
        "padding": "10px"
    }
}
```

### Handle Positioning

```python
node_with_handles = {
    "id": "handle-node",
    "type": "default",
    "position": {"x": 300, "y": 300},
    "data": {"label": "Custom Handles"},
    "sourcePosition": "right",
    "targetPosition": "left"
}
```

# Custom Nodes

Creating custom nodes is as easy as building a regular React component and passing it to the `node_types`. Since they’re standard React components, you can display any content and implement any functionality you need. Plus, you’ll have access to a range of props that allow you to extend and customize the default node behavior.

Below is an example custom node using a `color picker` component.

```python demo exec

from typing import Any

import reflex as rx

import reflex_enterprise as rxe
from reflex_enterprise.components.flow.types import Connection, Edge, Node


class CustomNodeState(rx.State):
    bg_color: rx.Field[str] = rx.field(default="#c9f1dd")
    nodes: rx.Field[list[Node]] = rx.field(
        default_factory=lambda: [
            {

                "type": "input",
                "data": {"label": "An input node"},
                "position": {"x": 0, "y": 50},
                "sourcePosition": "right",
                "style": {"color": "#000000",}
            },
            {
                "id": "2",
                "type": "selectorNode",

            ),
            on_edges_change=lambda changes: CustomNodeState.set_edges(
                rxe.flow.util.apply_edge_changes(CustomNodeState.edges, changes)
            ),

# Adding Interactivity to Your Flow

This guide shows how to create an interactive flow in Reflex, allowing you to select, drag, and connect nodes and edges.

## Define the State

We start by defining the nodes and edges of the flow. The `FlowState` class holds the nodes and edges as state variables and includes event handlers to respond to changes.

```python
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
from reflex_enterprise.components.flow.types import Node, Edge

class FlowState(rx.State):
    nodes: list[Node] = [
        {"id": "1", "type": "input", "position": {"x": 100, "y": 100}, "data": {"label": "Node 1"}},
        {"id": "2", "type": "default", "position": {"x": 300, "y": 200}, "data": {"label": "Node 2"}},
    ]

    edges: list[Edge] = [
        {"id": "e1-2", "source": "1", "target": "2", "label": "Connection", "type": "step"}
    ]
```

# Add Event Handlers

Event handlers allow the flow to respond to user interactions such as dragging nodes, updating edges, or creating new connections.

```python
@rx.event
def set_nodes(self, nodes: list[Node]):
    self.nodes = nodes

@rx.event
def set_edges(self, edges: list[Edge]):
    self.edges = edges

```

- set_nodes updates nodes when they are moved or edited.

- set_edges updates edges when they are modified or deleted.


## Render the Interactive Flow

Finally, we render the flow using **rxe.flow**, passing in the state and event handlers. Additional UI features include zoom/pan controls, a background grid, and a mini-map for navigation.

```python
def interactive_flow():
    return rx.box(
        rxe.flow(
            rxe.flow.controls(),
            rxe.flow.background(),
            rxe.flow.mini_map(),
            nodes=FlowState.nodes,
            edges=FlowState.edges,
            on_nodes_change=lambda node_changes: FlowState.set_nodes(
                rxe.flow.util.apply_node_changes(FlowState.nodes, node_changes)
            ),
            on_edges_change=lambda edge_changes: FlowState.set_edges(
                rxe.flow.util.apply_edge_changes(FlowState.edges, edge_changes)
            ),
            fit_view=True,

            attribution_position="bottom-right",
        ),
        height="100vh",
        width="100vw",
    )
```


# Hooks (API)

The `rxe.flow.api` module provides hooks to interact with the Flow instance. These hooks are wrappers around the `useReactFlow` hook from React Flow.

## Node Hooks

- `get_nodes()`: Returns an array of all nodes in the flow.
- `set_nodes(nodes)`: Sets the nodes in the flow.
- `add_nodes(nodes)`: Adds nodes to the flow.
- `get_node(id)`: Returns a node by its ID.
- `update_node(id, node_update, replace=False)`: Updates a node in the flow.
- `update_node_data(id, data_update, replace=False)`: Updates a node's data in the flow.

## Edge Hooks

- `get_edges()`: Returns an array of all edges in the flow.
- `set_edges(edges)`: Sets the edges in the flow.
- `add_edges(edges)`: Adds edges to the flow.
- `get_edge(id)`: Returns an edge by its ID.
- `update_edge(id, edge_update, replace=False)`: Updates an edge in the flow.
- `update_edge_data(id, data_update, replace=False)`: Updates an edge's data in the flow.

## Viewport Hooks

- `screen_to_flow_position(x, y, snap_to_grid=False)`: Translates a screen pixel position to a flow position.
- `flow_to_screen_position(x, y)`: Translates a position inside the flow’s canvas to a screen pixel position.

## Other Hooks

- `to_object()`: Converts the React Flow state to a JSON object.
- `get_intersecting_nodes(node, partially=True, nodes=None)`: Find all the nodes currently intersecting with a given node or rectangle.
- `get_node_connections(id=None, handle_type=None, handle_id=None)`: This hook returns an array of connections on a specific node, handle type ("source", "target") or handle ID.
- `get_connection()`: Returns the current connection state when there is an active connection interaction.


# Overview

At its core, a flow diagram is an interactive graph composed of nodes connected by edges. To help understand the key concepts, let’s go over the main components of a flow.

### Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of a flow. While there are a few default node types available, the real power comes from customizing them. You can design nodes to include interactive elements, display dynamic data, or support multiple connection points. The framework provides the foundation—you provide the functionality and style.

### Handles

Handles are the points on a node where edges attach. They typically appear on the top, bottom, left, or right sides of a node, but can be positioned and styled freely. Nodes can have multiple handles, allowing for complex connection setups.

### Edges

Edges are the connections between nodes. Each edge requires a source node and a target node. Edges can be styled and customized, and nodes with multiple handles can support multiple edges. Custom edges can include interactive elements, specialized routing, or unique visual styles beyond simple lines.

### Connection Line

When creating a new edge, you can click and drag from one handle to another. While dragging, the placeholder edge is called a connection line. Connection lines behave like edges and can be customized in appearance and behavior.

### Viewport

The viewport is the visible area containing the flow. Each node has x- and y-coordinates representing its position. Moving the viewport changes these coordinates, and zooming in or out adjusts the zoom level. The viewport ensures the diagram remains navigable and interactive.


# Flow Components

This page documents the main components provided by the `rxe.flow` library.

## rxe.flow.provider

The `FlowProvider` component is a context provider that makes it possible to access a flow’s internal state outside of the `<ReactFlow />` component. Many of the hooks we provide rely on this component to work.

**Props:**

- `initial_nodes`: `Sequence[Node]` - These nodes are used to initialize the flow. They are not dynamic.
- `default_edges`: `Sequence[Edge]` - These edges are used to initialize the flow. They are not dynamic.
- `initial_width`: `float` - The initial width is necessary to be able to use fitView on the server.
- `initial_height`: `float` - The initial height is necessary to be able to use fitView on the server.
- `fit_view`: `bool` - When true, the flow will be zoomed and panned to fit all the nodes initially provided.
- `initial_fit_view_options`: `FitViewOptions` - You can provide an object of options to customize the initial fitView behavior.
- `initial_min_zoom`: `float` - Initial minimum zoom level.
- `initial_max_zoom`: `float` - Initial maximum zoom level.
- `node_origin`: `NodeOrigin` - The origin of the node to use when placing it in the flow or looking up its x and y position.
- `node_extent`: `CoordinateExtent` - The boundary a node can be moved in.

## rxe.flow

The `Flow` component is the main component that renders the flow. It takes in nodes and edges, and provides event handlers for user interactions.

**Props:**

- `nodes`: `Sequence[Node]` - An array of nodes to render in a controlled flow.
- `edges`: `Sequence[Edge]` - An array of edges to render in a controlled flow.
- `default_nodes`: `Sequence[Node]` - The initial nodes to render in an uncontrolled flow.
- `default_edges`: `Sequence[Edge]` - The initial edges to render in an uncontrolled flow.
- `node_types`: `Mapping[str, Any]` - Custom node types.
- `edge_types`: `Mapping[str, Any]` - Custom edge types.
- `on_nodes_change`: Event handler for when nodes change.
- `on_edges_change`: Event handler for when edges change.
- `on_connect`: Event handler for when a connection is made.
- `fit_view`: `bool` - When true, the flow will be zoomed and panned to fit all the nodes initially provided.
- `fit_view_options`: `FitViewOptions` - Options for `fit_view`.
- `style`: The style of the component.

## rxe.flow.background

The `Background` component renders a background for the flow. It can be a pattern of lines, dots, or a cross.

**Props:**

- `color`: `str` - Color of the pattern.
- `bg_color`: `str` - Color of the background.
- `variant`: `Literal["lines", "dots", "cross"]` - The type of pattern to render.
- `gap`: `float | tuple[float, float]` - The gap between patterns.
- `size`: `float` - The size of the pattern elements.

**Example:**

```python
rxe.flow.background(variant="dots", gap=20, size=1)
```

## rxe.flow.controls

The `Controls` component renders a panel with buttons to zoom in, zoom out, fit the view, and lock the viewport.

**Props:**

- `show_zoom`: `bool` - Whether to show the zoom buttons.
- `show_fit_view`: `bool` - Whether to show the fit view button.
- `show_interactive`: `bool` - Whether to show the lock button.
- `position`: `PanelPosition` - The position of the controls on the pane.

**Example:**

```python
rxe.flow.controls()
```

## rxe.flow.mini_map

The `MiniMap` component renders a small overview of your flow.

**Props:**

- `node_color`: `str | Any` - Color of nodes on minimap.
- `node_stroke_color`: `str | Any` - Stroke color of nodes on minimap.
- `pannable`: `bool` - Determines whether you can pan the viewport by dragging inside the minimap.
- `zoomable`: `bool` - Determines whether you can zoom the viewport by scrolling inside the minimap.
- `position`: `PanelPosition` - Position of minimap on pane.

**Example:**

```python
rxe.flow.mini_map(pannable=True, zoomable=True)
```


# Theming

You can customize the appearance of the Flow component using CSS. The Flow component comes with a default theme, which you can override with your own styles.

## CSS Variables

The Flow component uses CSS variables for theming. You can override these variables to change the appearance of the flow. Here are some of the most common variables:

```css
.react-flow {
  --xy-background-color: #f7f9fb;
  --xy-node-border-default: 1px solid #ededed;
  --xy-node-boxshadow-default: 0px 3.54px 4.55px 0px #00000005,
    0px 3.54px 4.55px 0px #0000000d, 0px 0.51px 1.01px 0px #0000001a;
  --xy-node-border-radius-default: 8px;
  --xy-handle-background-color-default: #ffffff;
  --xy-handle-border-color-default: #aaaaaa;
  --xy-edge-label-color-default: #505050;
}
```

## Custom Stylesheets

You can add custom stylesheets to your app to override the default styles. To do this, add the `stylesheets` prop to your `rxe.App` or `rx.App` instance:

```python
app = rxe.App(
    stylesheets=[
        "/css/my-custom-styles.css",
    ],
)
```

Then, create a file `assets/css/my-custom-styles.css` in your project and add your custom styles there.

## Customizing Node and Edge Styles

You can also apply custom styles to individual nodes and edges using the `style` and `className` props.

### Using the style prop

You can pass a style dictionary to the `style` prop of a node or edge:

```python
node = {
    "id": "1",
    "position": {"x": 100, "y": 100},
    "data": {"label": "Node 1"},
    "style": {"backgroundColor": "#ffcc00"},
}
```

### Using the className prop

You can also pass a class name to the `className` prop and define the styles in your CSS file:

```python
# In your python code
node = {
    "id": "1",
    "position": {"x": 100, "y": 100},
    "data": {"label": "Node 1"},
    "className": "my-custom-node",
}
```

```css
/* In your CSS file */
.my-custom-node {
    background-color: #ffcc00;
    border: 2px solid #ff9900;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```


# Utility Functions

The `rxe.flow.util` module provides utility functions for working with Flow components.

## Path Utilities

These functions are used to calculate the path for an edge.

- `get_simple_bezier_path(source_x, source_y, target_x, target_y, source_position="bottom", target_position="top")`: Returns everything you need to render a simple bezier edge between two nodes.
- `get_bezier_path(source_x, source_y, target_x, target_y, source_position="bottom", target_position="top", curvature=0.5)`: Returns everything you need to render a bezier edge between two nodes.
- `get_straight_path(source_x, source_y, target_x, target_y)`: Calculates the straight line path between two points.
- `get_smooth_step_path(source_x, source_y, target_x, target_y, source_position="bottom", target_position="top", border_radius=5, center_x=None, center_y=None, offset=20, step_position=0.5)`: Returns everything you need to render a stepped path between two nodes.

## Change Handlers

These functions are used to apply changes to nodes and edges from the `on_nodes_change` and `on_edges_change` event handlers.

- `apply_node_changes(nodes, changes)`: Applies changes to nodes in the flow.
- `apply_edge_changes(edges, changes)`: Applies changes to edges in the flow.

## Edge and Connection Utilities

- `add_edge(params, edges)`: Creates a new edge in the flow.

## Graph Utilities

- `get_incomers(node_id, nodes, edges)`: Returns all incoming nodes connected to the given node.
- `get_outgoers(node_id, nodes, edges)`: Returns all outgoing nodes connected to the given node.
- `get_connected_edges(nodes, edges)`: Returns all edges connected to the given nodes.

# Interactive Maps

```python exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
from pcweb.pages.docs import enterprise
```

The map components in Reflex Enterprise provide interactive mapping capabilities built on top of **Leaflet**, one of the most popular open-source JavaScript mapping libraries. These components enable you to create rich, interactive maps with markers, layers, controls, and event handling.

```md alert info
# All map components are built using Leaflet and react-leaflet, providing a familiar and powerful mapping experience.
For advanced Leaflet features, refer to the [Leaflet documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html).
```

🌍 **[View Live Demo](https://map.reflex.run)** - See the map components in action with interactive examples.

## Installation & Setup

Map components are included with `reflex-enterprise`. No additional installation is required.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of creating a map with a marker:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

class MapState(rx.State):
    center: rxe.map.LatLng = rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.505, lng=-0.09)
    zoom: float = 13.0

def basic_map():
    return rxe.map(
        rxe.map.tile_layer(
            url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
            attribution='&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
        ),
        rxe.map.marker(
            rxe.map.popup("Hello from London!"),
            position=MapState.center,
        ),
        id="basic-map",
        center=MapState.center,
        zoom=MapState.zoom,
        height="400px",
        width="100%",
    )
```

## Core Components

### Map Container

The `rxe.map()` component is the primary container that holds all other map elements:

```python
rxe.map(
    # Child components (markers, layers, controls)
    id="my-map",
    center=rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.505, lng=-0.09),
    zoom=13,
    height="400px",
    width="100%"
)
```

**Key Properties:**
- `center`: Initial map center coordinates
- `zoom`: Initial zoom level (0-18+ depending on tile provider)
- `bounds`: Alternative to center/zoom, fits map to bounds
- `height`/`width`: Map container dimensions

### Tile Layers

Tile layers provide the base map imagery. The most common is OpenStreetMap:

```python
rxe.map.tile_layer(
    url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
    attribution='&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors'
)
```


### Markers

Add point markers to specific locations:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

def markers_example():
    return rxe.map(
        rxe.map.tile_layer(
            url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
            attribution='&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors'
        ),
        rxe.map.marker(
            rxe.map.popup(
                rx.vstack(
                    rx.text("Big Ben", weight="bold"),
                    rx.text("Famous clock tower in London"),
                    spacing="2"
                )
            ),
            position=rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.4994, lng=-0.1245),
        ),
        rxe.map.marker(
            rxe.map.popup("London Eye"),
            position=rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.5033, lng=-0.1196),
        ),
        id="markers-map",
        center=rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.501, lng=-0.122),
        zoom=14,
        height="400px",
        width="100%",
    )
```

### Vector Layers

Draw shapes and areas on the map:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

def vectors_example():
    return rxe.map(
        rxe.map.tile_layer(
            url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
            attribution='&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors'
        ),
        # Circle (radius in meters)
        rxe.map.circle(
            center=rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.505, lng=-0.09),
            radius=500,
            path_options=rxe.map.path_options(
                color="#ff0000",
                fill_color="#ff3333",
                fill_opacity=0.3,
                weight=2
            )
        ),
        # Polygon
        rxe.map.polygon(
            positions=[
                rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.515, lng=-0.08),
                rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.515, lng=-0.07),
                rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.520, lng=-0.07),
                rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.520, lng=-0.08),
            ],
            path_options=rxe.map.path_options(
                color="#0000ff",
                fill_color="#3333ff",
                fill_opacity=0.3
            )
        ),
        # Polyline
        rxe.map.polyline(
            positions=[
                rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.500, lng=-0.095),
                rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.510, lng=-0.085),
                rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.515, lng=-0.095),
            ],
            path_options=rxe.map.path_options(
                color="#00ff00",
                weight=4
            )
        ),
        id="vectors-map",
        center=rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.510, lng=-0.08),
        zoom=13,
        height="400px",
        width="100%",
    )
```

## Interactive Features

### Event Handling

Maps support comprehensive event handling for user interactions:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

class InteractiveMapState(rx.State):
    last_click: str = "No clicks yet"
    current_zoom: float = 13.0

    def handle_map_click(self, event):
        lat = event.get("latlng", {}).get("lat", 0)
        lng = event.get("latlng", {}).get("lng", 0)
        self.last_click = f"Clicked at: {lat:.4f}, {lng:.4f}"

    def handle_zoom_change(self, event):
        self.current_zoom = float(event.get("target", {}).get("_zoom", 13.0))

def interactive_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text(f"Last click: {InteractiveMapState.last_click}"),
        rx.text(f"Current zoom: {InteractiveMapState.current_zoom}"),
        rxe.map(
            rxe.map.tile_layer(
                url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
                attribution='&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors'
            ),
            id="interactive-map",
            center=rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.505, lng=-0.09),
            zoom=InteractiveMapState.current_zoom,
            height="350px",
            width="100%",
            on_click=InteractiveMapState.handle_map_click,
            on_zoom=InteractiveMapState.handle_zoom_change,
        ),
        spacing="3"
    )
```

### Map Controls

Add UI controls for enhanced user interaction:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

def controls_example():
    return rxe.map(
        rxe.map.tile_layer(
            url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
            attribution='&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors'
        ),
        rxe.map.zoom_control(position="topright"),
        rxe.map.scale_control(position="bottomleft"),
        rxe.map.attribution_control(position="bottomright"),
        id="controls-map",
        center=rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.505, lng=-0.09),
        zoom=13,
        height="400px",
        width="100%",
    )
```

## Helper Functions

### Coordinate Creation

```python
# Create latitude/longitude coordinates
center = rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.505, lng=-0.09, nround=4)

# Create bounds
bounds = rxe.map.latlng_bounds(
    corner1_lat=51.49, corner1_lng=-0.11,
    corner2_lat=51.52, corner2_lng=-0.07
)
```

## Map API

The Map API provides programmatic control over your maps, allowing you to manipulate the map programmatically from your Reflex state methods.

### Getting the API Reference

To access the Map API, you need to get a reference to your map using its ID:

```python
map_api = rxe.map.api("my-map-id")
```

### Interactive Demo

Here are some commonly used API methods demonstrated in action:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

map_api = rxe.map.api("api-demo-map")

class MapAPIState(rx.State):
    current_location: str = "London"

    def fly_to_london(self):
        yield map_api.fly_to([51.505, -0.09], 13)
        self.current_location = "London"

    def fly_to_paris(self):
        yield map_api.fly_to([48.8566, 2.3522], 13)
        self.current_location = "Paris"

def map_api_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text(f"Current location: {MapAPIState.current_location}"),
        rx.hstack(
            rx.button("Fly to London", on_click=MapAPIState.fly_to_london),
            rx.button("Fly to Paris", on_click=MapAPIState.fly_to_paris),
            rx.button("Zoom Out", on_click=map_api.set_zoom(8)),
            rx.button("Log Center", on_click=map_api.get_center(callback=rx.console_log)),
            spacing="2"
        ),
        rxe.map(
            rxe.map.tile_layer(
                url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
                attribution='&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors'
            ),
            id="api-demo-map",
            center=rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.505, lng=-0.09),
            zoom=13.0,
            height="350px",
            width="100%",
        ),
        spacing="3"
    )
```

### Common API Methods

**View Control:**
- `fly_to(latlng, zoom, options)` - Smooth animated movement to location
- `set_view(latlng, zoom, options)` - Instant movement to location
- `set_zoom(zoom)` - Change zoom level
- `zoom_in()` / `zoom_out()` - Zoom by one level
- `fit_bounds(bounds, options)` - Fit map to specific bounds

**Location Services:**
- `locate(options)` - Get user's current location
- `stop_locate()` - Stop location tracking

**Information Retrieval:**
- `get_center(callback)` - Get current map center
- `get_zoom(callback)` - Get current zoom level
- `get_bounds(callback)` - Get current map bounds
- `get_size(callback)` - Get map container size

**Layer Management:**
- `add_layer(layer)` - Add a layer to the map
- `remove_layer(layer)` - Remove a layer from the map
- `has_layer(layer)` - Check if layer exists on map

### Full Leaflet API Access

```md alert info
# The Map API provides access to the complete Leaflet map API. Any method available on a Leaflet map instance can be called through the MapAPI instance.
Function names are automatically converted from snake_case (Python) to camelCase (JavaScript).
```

This means you can use any method from the [Leaflet Map documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#map). For example:

**Python (snake_case) → JavaScript (camelCase):**
- `map_api.pan_to(latlng)` → `map.panTo(latlng)`
- `map_api.set_max_bounds(bounds)` → `map.setMaxBounds(bounds)`
- `map_api.get_pixel_bounds()` → `map.getPixelBounds()`
- `map_api.container_point_to_lat_lng(point)` → `map.containerPointToLatLng(point)`

### Advanced Example

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

class AdvancedMapState(rx.State):
    constraints_applied: bool = False
    location_tracking: bool = False

        # Set maximum bounds (restrict panning to London area)
        max_bounds = rxe.map.latlng_bounds(
            corner1_lat=51.4, corner1_lng=-0.3,

        yield map_api.set_min_zoom(1)
        yield map_api.set_max_zoom(18)

        # Re-enable scroll wheel zoom
        yield map_api.scroll_wheel_zoom(True)

        self.constraints_applied = False

    def toggle_location_tracking(self):

        if self.location_tracking == False:
            # Start location tracking
            locate_options = rxe.map.locate_options(
                set_view=True,
                max_zoom=16,
                timeout=10000,
                enable_high_accuracy=True,
                watch=False  # Single location request
            )
            yield map_api.locate(locate_options)
            self.location_tracking = True
            self.location_status = "Requesting location..."
        else:
            # Stop location tracking
            yield map_api.stop_locate()
            self.location_tracking = False
            self.location_status = "Location tracking disabled"

def advanced_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.hstack(
            rx.button(
                rx.cond(AdvancedMapState.constraints_applied, "Remove Constraints", "Apply Constraints"),
                on_click=rx.cond(AdvancedMapState.constraints_applied, AdvancedMapState.remove_constraints, AdvancedMapState.setup_map_constraints),

                on_click=AdvancedMapState.toggle_location_tracking,
                color_scheme="green"
            ),
            spacing="3"
        ),
        rx.text(f"Status: {AdvancedMapState.location_status}"),
        rx.text(
            rx.cond(
                AdvancedMapState.constraints_applied,
                "Constraints: Applied (restricted to London area, zoom 10-16, no scroll wheel)",
                "Constraints: None"
            )
        ),
        rxe.map(
            rxe.map.tile_layer(
                url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
                attribution='&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors'
            ),
            rxe.map.marker(
                rxe.map.popup("Try panning and zooming when constraints are applied!"),
                position=rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.505, lng=-0.09),
            ),
            id="advanced-demo-map",
            center=rxe.map.latlng(lat=51.505, lng=-0.09),
            zoom=12.0,
            height="400px",
            width="100%",
            on_locationfound=lambda e: AdvancedMapState.set_location_status("Location found!"),
            on_locationerror=lambda e: AdvancedMapState.set_location_status("Location error - permission denied or unavailable"),
        ),
        spacing="3"
    )
```

### Callback Handling

Many API methods that retrieve information require callbacks to handle the results:

```python
class CallbackMapState(rx.State):
    map_info: str = ""

    def handle_center_result(self, result):
        lat = result.get("lat", 0)
        lng = result.get("lng", 0)
        self.map_info = f"Center: {lat:.4f}, {lng:.4f}"

    def handle_bounds_result(self, result):
        # result will contain bounds information
        self.map_info = f"Bounds: {result}"

    def get_map_info(self):
        map_api = rxe.map.api("info-map")
        yield map_api.get_center(self.handle_center_result)
        # or
        yield map_api.get_bounds(self.handle_bounds_result)
```

## Available Events

The map components support a comprehensive set of events:

**Map Events:**
- `on_click`, `on_dblclick` - Mouse click events
- `on_zoom`, `on_zoom_start`, `on_zoom_end` - Zoom events
- `on_move`, `on_move_start`, `on_move_end` - Pan events
- `on_resize` - Map container resize
- `on_load`, `on_unload` - Map lifecycle

**Location Events:**
- `on_locationfound`, `on_locationerror` - Geolocation

**Layer Events:**
- `on_layeradd`, `on_layerremove` - Layer management

**Popup Events:**
- `on_popupopen`, `on_popupclose` - Popup lifecycle
- `on_tooltipopen`, `on_tooltipclose` - Tooltip lifecycle

## Common Patterns

### Dynamic Markers

```python
class DynamicMapState(rx.State):
    markers: list[dict] = [
        {"lat": 51.505, "lng": -0.09, "title": "London"},
        {"lat": 48.8566, "lng": 2.3522, "title": "Paris"},
        {"lat": 52.5200, "lng": 13.4050, "title": "Berlin"},
    ]

def dynamic_markers():
    return rxe.map(
        rxe.map.tile_layer(url="..."),
        rx.foreach(
            DynamicMapState.markers,
            lambda marker: rxe.map.marker(
                rxe.map.popup(marker["title"]),
                position=rxe.map.latlng(
                    lat=marker["lat"],
                    lng=marker["lng"]
                )
            )
        ),
        # ... map configuration
    )
```


## Best Practices

1. **Always include attribution** for tile providers
2. **Set reasonable zoom levels** (typically 1-18)
3. **Use bounds for multiple markers** instead of arbitrary center/zoom
4. **Handle loading states** for dynamic map content
5. **Optimize marker rendering** for large datasets using clustering
6. **Test on mobile devices** for touch interactions

```

## Example

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

class PillInputState(rx.State):
    """State for the PillsInput demo."""

    tags: set[str] = {"Foo", "Bar"}

    @rx.event
    def add_tag(self, tag: str):
        """Add a tag to the list of tags."""
        self.tags.add(tag)

    @rx.event
    def remove_tag(self, tag: str):
        """Remove a tag from the list of tags."""
        self.tags.remove(tag)

# Pivot Mode

Pivot mode allows you to visualize your data in a different way than how they are originally structured in the data source. When pivoting on a column, the values in that column will be used as column headers. This allows you to see the data in a more compact way, and can be useful when you have a lot of data to display.

To enable pivot mode, set the `pivot_mode` property to `True` in the grid props. Once pivot mode is enabled, you can define which column to pivot on by setting the `pivot` property in a column definition. In addition to the pivot column, at least one column definition must have `row_group` property set to `True` to define the row grouping.

You can also define how rows are aggregated by passing the `agg_func` property in the column definition. The `agg_func` property should be set to a string that represents the aggregation function to use. The built-in aggregation functions are `sum`, `min`, `max`, `count`, `avg`, `first`, and `last`.

You can find a live example here: [Pivot Mode Example](https://aggrid.reflex.run/pivot).

```python demo exec
import pandas as pd
import reflex as rx

You can style your grid with a theme. AG Grid includes the following themes:

1. `quartz`
2. `alpine`
3. `balham`
4. `material`

The grid uses `quartz` by default. To use any other theme, set it using the `theme` prop, i.e. `theme="alpine"`.

```python

# Value Transformers

AgGrid allow you to apply transformers based on the column of your grid. This allow you to perform operations on the data before displaying it on the grid, without having to pre-process the data on the backend, reducing the load on your application.

TOC:
- [Value Getter](#value-getter)
- [Value Formatter](#value-formatter)

## Value Getter

`value_getter` is a property of the column definition that allows you to define a function that will be called to get the value of the cell. This function will receive the row data as a parameter and should return the value to be displayed on the cell.

If you have two columns `col_a` and `col_b` and you want to display the sum of these two columns in a third column `sum`, you can define the `value_getter` of `sum` as follows:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd


df = pd.DataFrame({"col_a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "col_b": [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]})

column_defs = [
    {"field": "col_a", "header_name": "Column A"},
    {"field": "col_b", "header_name": "Column B"},
    {"field": "sum", "header_name": "Sum", "value_getter": "params.data.col_a + params.data.col_b"},
    rxe.ag_grid.column_def(field="diff", header_name="Difference", value_getter="params.data.col_b - params.data.col_a"),
]

def ag_grid_value_getter():
    return rxe.ag_grid(
        id="ag_grid_value_getter",
        row_data=df.to_dict("records"),
        column_defs=column_defs,
        width="100%",
    )
```

## Value Formatter

`value_formatter` is a property of the column definition that allows you to define a function that will be called to format the value of the cell. This function will receive the value of the cell as a parameter and should return the formatted value to be displayed on the cell.

If you have a column `price` and you want to display the price with a currency symbol, you can define the `value_formatter` of `price` as follows:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({"product_name":["Product A", "Product B", "Product C", "Product D", "Product E"], "price": [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]})
column_defs = [
    {"field": "product_name", "header_name": "Product Name"},
    {"field": "price", "header_name": "Price ($)", "value_formatter": "'$' + params.value"},
    rxe.ag_grid.column_def(col_id="price_eur", header_name="Price (€)", value_formatter="params.data.price + ' €'"),
]

def ag_grid_value_formatter():
    return rxe.ag_grid(
        id="ag_grid_value_formatter",
        row_data=df.to_dict("records"),
        column_defs=column_defs,
        width="100%",
    )
```

title: Aligned Grids
---

AgGrid provides a way to align multiple grids together. This is useful when you want to display related data in a synchronized manner.

You can do so through the `aligned_grids` prop. This prop takes a list of grid IDs that you want to align.

```python demo exec
import pandas as pd
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

# Olympic winners data (originally from https://www.ag-grid.com/example-assets/olympic-winners.json)
df = pd.read_json("data/olympic-winners.json")

row_data = df.to_dict("records")

column_defs = [
    {"field": "athlete"},
    {"field": "age"},
    {"field": "country"},
    {"field": "year"},
    {"field": "sport"},
    {
        "header_name": "Medals",
        "children": [
            {
                "field": "total",
                "column_group_show": "closed",
                "col_id": "total",
                "value_getter": "params.data.gold + params.data.silver + params.data.bronze",
                "width": 100,
            },
            {"field": "gold", "column_group_show": "open", "width": 100},
            {"field": "silver", "column_group_show": "open", "width": 100},
            {"field": "bronze", "column_group_show": "open", "width": 100},
        ],
    },
]

def aligned_grids_page():
    """Aligned grids demo."""
    return rx.el.div(
        rxe.ag_grid(
            id="grid1",
            column_defs=column_defs,
            row_data=row_data,
            aligned_grids=["grid2"],
            width="100%",
        ), rxe.ag_grid(
            id="grid2",

# AG Grid

AG Grid is a powerful, feature-rich data grid component that brings enterprise-grade table functionality to your Reflex applications. With support for sorting, filtering, pagination, row selection, and much more, AG Grid transforms how you display and interact with tabular data.

[Explore the full AG Grid showcase and examples](https://aggrid.reflex.run/)

## Your First Reflex AG Grid

A basic Reflex AG Grid contains column definitions `column_defs`, which define the columns to be displayed in the grid, and `row_data`, which contains the data to be displayed in the grid.

Each grid also requires a unique `id`, which is needed to uniquely identify the Ag-Grid instance on the page. If you have multiple grids on the same page, each grid must have a unique `id` so that it can be correctly rendered and managed.

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd


df = pd.read_csv("data/wind_dataset.csv")

column_defs = [
    {"field": "direction"},
    {"field": "strength"},
    {"field": "frequency"},
]

def ag_grid_simple():
    return rxe.ag_grid(
        id="ag_grid_basic_1",
        row_data=df.to_dict("records"),
        column_defs=column_defs,
        width="100%",
    )
```

📊 **Dataset source:** [wind_dataset.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/wind_dataset.csv)

The format of the data passed to the `row_data` prop is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a row in the grid as seen below.

```python
[
   \{"direction": "N", "strength": "0-1", "frequency": 0.5\},
   \{"direction": "NNE", "strength": "0-1", "frequency": 0.6\},
   \{"direction": "NE", "strength": "0-1", "frequency": 0.5\},
]
```

The previous example showed the `column_defs` written out in full. You can also extract the required information from the dataframe's column names:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data/wind_dataset.csv")


def ag_grid_simple_2():
    return rxe.ag_grid(
        id="ag_grid_basic_2",
        row_data=df.to_dict("records"),
        column_defs=[{"field": i} for i in df.columns],
        width="100%",
        height="40vh",
    )
```

📊 **Dataset source:** [wind_dataset.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/wind_dataset.csv)

## Headers

In the above example, the first letter of the field names provided are capitalized when displaying the header name. You can customize the header names by providing a `header_name` key in the column definition. In this example, the `header_name` is customized for the second and third columns.

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd


df = pd.read_csv("data/gapminder2007.csv")

column_defs = [
    {"field": "country"},
    {"field": "pop", "headerName": "Population"},
    {"field": "lifeExp", "headerName": "Life Expectancy"},
]

def ag_grid_simple_headers():
    return rxe.ag_grid(
            id="ag_grid_basic_headers",
            row_data=df.to_dict("records"),
            column_defs=column_defs,
            width="100%",
            height="40vh",

## Column Filtering

Allow a user to filter a column by setting the `filter` key to `True` in the column definition. In this example we enable filtering for the first and last columns.

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd


df = pd.read_csv("data/gapminder2007.csv")

column_defs =  [
    {"field": "country", "headerName": "Country", "filter": True},
    {"field": "pop", "headerName": "Population"},
    {"field": "lifeExp", "headerName": "Life Expectancy", "filter": True},
]

def ag_grid_simple_column_filtering():
    return rxe.ag_grid(
        id="ag_grid_basic_column_filtering",
        row_data=df.to_dict("records"),
        column_defs=column_defs,
        width="100%",
        height="40vh",
    )
```

### Filter Types

You can set `filter=True` to enable the default filter for a column.

You can also set the filter type using the `filter` key. The following filter types are available: `ag_grid.filters.date`, `ag_grid.filters.number` and `ag_grid.filters.text`. These ensure that the input you enter to the filter is of the correct type.

(`ag_grid.filters.set` and `ag_grid.filters.multi` are available with AG Grid Enterprise)

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd


df = pd.read_csv("data/GanttChart-updated.csv")

column_defs =  [
    {"field": "Task", "filter": True},
    {"field": "Start", "filter": rxe.ag_grid.filters.date},
    {"field": "Duration", "filter": rxe.ag_grid.filters.number},
    {"field": "Resource", "filter": rxe.ag_grid.filters.text},
]

def ag_grid_simple_column_filtering():
    return rxe.ag_grid(
        id="ag_grid_basic_column_filtering",
        row_data=df.to_dict("records"),
        column_defs=column_defs,
        width="100%",
        height="40vh",
    )
```

## Row Sorting

By default, the rows can be sorted by any column by clicking on the column header. You can disable sorting of the rows for a column by setting the `sortable` key to `False` in the column definition.

In this example, we disable sorting for the first column.

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd


df = pd.read_csv("data/gapminder2007.csv")

column_defs =  [
    {"field": "country", "sortable": False},
    {"field": "pop", "headerName": "Population"},
    {"field": "lifeExp", "headerName": "Life Expectancy"},
]

def ag_grid_simple_row_sorting():
    return rxe.ag_grid(
        id="ag_grid_basic_row_sorting",
        row_data=df.to_dict("records"),
        column_defs=column_defs,
        width="100%",
        height="40vh",
    )
```

📊 **Dataset source:** [gapminder2007.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminder2007.csv)

## Row Selection

Row Selection is enabled using the `row_selection` attribute. Setting it to `multiple` allows users to select multiple rows at a time. You can use the `checkbox_selection` column definition attribute to render checkboxes for selection.

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd


df = pd.read_csv("data/gapminder2007.csv")

column_defs = [
    {"field": "country", "checkboxSelection": True},
    {"field": "pop", "headerName": "Population"},
    {"field": "continent"},
]

def ag_grid_simple_row_selection():
    return rxe.ag_grid(
        id="ag_grid_basic_row_selection",
        row_data=df.to_dict("records"),
        column_defs=column_defs,
        row_selection={"mode":"multiple"},
        width="100%",
        height="40vh",
    )
```

📊 **Dataset source:** [gapminder2007.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminder2007.csv)

## Editing

Enable Editing by setting the `editable` attribute to `True`. The cell editor is inferred from the cell data type. Set the cell editor type using the `cell_editor` attribute.

There are 7 provided cell editors in AG Grid:

1. `ag_grid.editors.text`
2. `ag_grid.editors.large_text`
3. `ag_grid.editors.select`
4. `ag_grid.editors.rich_select`
5. `ag_grid.editors.number`
6. `ag_grid.editors.date`
7. `ag_grid.editors.checkbox`

In this example, we enable editing for the second and third columns. The second column uses the `number` cell editor, and the third column uses the `select` cell editor.

The `on_cell_value_changed` event trigger is linked to the `cell_value_changed` event handler in the state. This event handler is called whenever a cell value is changed and changes the value of the backend var `_data_df` and the state var `data`.

```python
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd

class AGGridEditingState(rx.State):
    data: list[dict] = []
    _data_df: pd.DataFrame

    @rx.event
    def load_data(self):
        self._data_df = pd.read_csv("data/gapminder2007.csv")
        self.data = self._data_df.to_dict("records")

    @rx.event
    def cell_value_changed(self, row, col_field, new_value):
        self._data_df.at[row, col_field] = new_value
        self.data = self._data_df.to_dict("records")
        yield rx.toast(f"Cell value changed, Row: {row}, Column: {col_field}, New Value: {new_value}")


column_defs = [
    \{"field": "country"\},
    \{"field": "pop", "headerName": "Population", "editable": True, "cellEditor": rxe.ag_grid.editors.number\},
    \{"field": "continent", "editable": True, "cellEditor": rxe.ag_grid.editors.select, "cellEditorParams": \{"values": ['Asia', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'Americas', 'Oceania']\}\},
]

def ag_grid_simple_editing():
    return rxe.ag_grid(
        id="ag_grid_basic_editing",
        row_data=AGGridEditingState.data,
        column_defs=column_defs,
        on_cell_value_changed=AGGridEditingState.cell_value_changed,
        on_mount=AGGridEditingState.load_data,
        width="100%",
        height="40vh",
    )
```

## Pagination

By default, the grid uses a vertical scroll. You can reduce the amount of scrolling required by adding pagination. To add pagination, set `pagination=True`. You can set the `pagination_page_size` to the number of rows per page and `pagination_page_size_selector` to a list of options for the user to select from.

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data/gapminder2007.csv")

column_defs = [
    {"field": "country"},
    {"field": "pop", "headerName": "Population"},
    {"field": "lifeExp", "headerName": "Life Expectancy"},
]

def ag_grid_simple_pagination():
    return rxe.ag_grid(
        id="ag_grid_basic_pagination",
        row_data=df.to_dict("records"),
        column_defs=column_defs,
        pagination=True,
        pagination_page_size=10,
        pagination_page_size_selector=[10, 40, 100],
        width="100%",
        height="40vh",
    )
```

## AG Grid with State

### Putting Data in State

Assuming you want to make any edit to your data, you can put the data in State. This allows you to update the grid based on user input. Whenever the `data` var is updated, the grid will be re-rendered with the new data.

```python
from typing import Any
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd

class AGGridState2(rx.State):
    data: list[dict] = []

    @rx.event
    def load_data(self):
        _df = pd.read_csv("data/gapminder2007.csv")
        self.data = _df.to_dict("records")

column_defs = [
    \{"field": "country"\},
    \{"field": "pop", "headerName": "Population"\},
    \{"field": "continent"\},
]

def ag_grid_state_2():
    return rxe.ag_grid(
        id="ag_grid_state_2",
        row_data=AGGridState2.data,
        column_defs=column_defs,
        on_mount=AGGridState2.load_data,
        width="100%",
        height="40vh",
    )
```

### Updating the Grid with State

You can use State to update the grid based on a users input. In this example, we update the `column_defs` of the grid when a user clicks a button.

```python
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd

class AgGridState(rx.State):
    """The app state."""
    all_columns: list = []

    two_columns: list = []
    column_defs: list = all_columns
    n_clicks = 0

    @rx.event
    def init_columns(self):
        self.all_columns = [
            \{"field": "country"\},
            \{"field": "pop"\},
            \{"field": "continent"\},
            \{"field": "lifeExp"\},
            \{"field": "gdpPercap"\},
        ]
        self.two_columns = [
            \{"field": "country"\},
            \{"field": "pop"\},
        ]
        self.column_defs = self.all_columns

    @rx.event
    def update_columns(self):
        self.n_clicks += 1
        if self.n_clicks % 2 != 0:
            self.column_defs = self.two_columns
        else:
            self.column_defs = self.all_columns


df = pd.read_csv("data/gapminder2007.csv")


def ag_grid_simple_with_state():
    return rx.box(
        rx.button("Toggle Columns", on_click=AgGridState.update_columns),
        rxe.ag_grid(
            id="ag_grid_basic_with_state",
            row_data=df.to_dict("records"),
            column_defs=AgGridState.column_defs,
            on_mount=AgGridState.init_columns,
            width="100%",
            height="40vh",
        ),
        width="100%",
    )

## AG Grid with Data from a Database

In this example, we will use a database to store the data. The data is loaded from a csv file and inserted into the database when the page is loaded using the `insert_dataframe_to_db` event handler.

The data is then fetched from the database and displayed in the grid using the `data` computed var.

When a cell value is changed, the data is updated in the database using the `cell_value_changed` event handler.

```python
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd
from sqlmodel import select

class Country(rx.Model, table=True):
    country: str
    population: int
    continent: str


class AGGridDatabaseState(rx.State):

    countries: list[Country]

    # Insert data from a csv loaded dataframe to the database (Do this on the page load)
    @rx.event
    def insert_dataframe_to_db(self):
        data = pd.read_csv("data/gapminder2007.csv")
        with rx.session() as session:
            for _, row in data.iterrows():
                db_record = Country(
                    country=row['country'],
                    population=row['pop'],
                    continent=row['continent'],
                )
                session.add(db_record)
            session.commit()

    # Fetch data from the database using a computed variable
    @rx.var
    def data(self) -> list[dict]:
        with rx.session() as session:
            results = session.exec(select(Country)).all()
            self.countries = [result.dict() for result in results]
        return self.countries

    # Update the database when a cell value is changed
    @rx.event
    def cell_value_changed(self, row, col_field, new_value):
        self.countries[row][col_field] = new_value
        with rx.session() as session:
            country = Country(**self.countries[row])
            session.merge(country)
            session.commit()
        yield rx.toast(f"Cell value changed, Row: \{row}, Column: \{col_field}, New Value: \{new_value}")


column_defs = [
    \{"field": "country"\},
    \{"field": "population", "headerName": "Population", "editable": True, "cellEditor": rxe.ag_grid.editors.number\},
    \{"field": "continent", "editable": True, "cellEditor": rxe.ag_grid.editors.select, "cellEditorParams": \{"values": ['Asia', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'Americas', 'Oceania']\}\},
]

def index():
    return rxe.ag_grid(
        id="ag_grid_basic_editing",
        row_data=AGGridDatabaseState.data,
        column_defs=column_defs,
        on_cell_value_changed=AGGridDatabaseState.cell_value_changed,
        width="100%",
        height="40vh",
    )

# Add state and page to the app.
app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index, on_load=AGGridDatabaseState.insert_dataframe_to_db)
```

## Using AG Grid Enterprise

AG Grid offers both community and enterprise versions. See the [AG Grid docs](https://www.ag-grid.com/archive/31.2.0/react-data-grid/licensing/) for details on purchasing a license key.

To use an AG Grid Enterprise license key with Reflex AG Grid set the environment variable `AG_GRID_LICENSE_KEY`:

```bash
export AG_GRID_LICENSE_KEY="your_license_key"
```

## column_def props

The following props are available for `column_defs` as well as many others that can be found here: [AG Grid Column Def Docs](https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/column-properties/). (it is necessary to use snake_case for the keys in Reflex, unlike in the AG Grid docs where camelCase is used)

- `field`: `str`: The field of the row object to get the cell's data from.
- `col_id`: `str | None`: The unique ID to give the column. This is optional. If missing, the ID will default to the field.
- `type`: `str | None`: The type of the column.
- `cell_data_type`: `bool | str | None`: The data type of the cell values for this column. Can either infer the data type from the row data (true - the default behaviour), define a specific data type (string), or have no data type (false).
- `hide`: `bool`: Set to true for this column to be hidden.
- `editable`: `bool | None`: Set to true if this column is editable, otherwise false.
- `filter`: `AGFilters | str | None`: Filter component to use for this column. Set to true to use the default filter. Set to the name of a provided filter to use that filter. (Check out the Filter Types section of this page for more information)
- `floating_filter`: `bool`: Whether to display a floating filter for this column.
- `header_name`: `str | None`: The name to render in the column header. If not specified and field is specified, the field name will be used as the header name.
- `header_tooltip`: `str | None`: Tooltip for the column header.
- `checkbox_selection`: `bool | None`: Set to true to render a checkbox for row selection.
- `cell_editor`: `AGEditors | str | None`: Provide your own cell editor component for this column's cells. (Check out the Editing section of this page for more information)
- `cell_editor_params`: `dict[str, list[Any]] | None`: Params to be passed to the cellEditor component.



## Functionality you need is not available/working in Reflex

All AGGrid options found in this [documentation](https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/reference/) are mapped in rxe.ag_grid, but some features might not have been fully tested, due to the sheer number of existing features in the underlying AG Grid library.

If one of the ag_grid props does not import the expected module, you can pass it manually via the props `community_modules` or `enterprise_modules`, which expect a `set[str]` of the module names. You will get a warning in the browser console if a module is missing, so you can check there if a feature is not working as expected.

You can also report the missing module on our discord or GitHub issues page of the main Reflex repository.

Best practice is to create a single instance of `ag_grid.api()` with the same `id` as the `id` of the `ag_grid` component that is to be referenced, `"ag_grid_basic_row_selection"` in this first example.

The example below uses the `select_all()` and `deselect_all()` methods of the AG Grid API to select and deselect all rows in the grid. This method is not available in Reflex directly. Check out this [documentation](https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/grid-api/#reference-selection-selectAll) to see what the methods look like in the AG Grid docs.

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd

    "data/gapminder2007.csv"
)

    {"field": "country", "checkboxSelection": True},
    {"field": "pop"},
    {"field": "continent"},

def ag_grid_api_simple():

        rx.button("Deselect All", on_click=my_api.deselect_all()),
        spacing="4",
        width="100%",
    )
```

📊 **Dataset source:** [gapminder2007.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminder2007.csv)

The react code for the `select_all()` event handler is `selectAll = (source?: SelectionEventSourceType) => void;`.

To use this in Reflex as you can see, it should be called in snake case rather than camel case. The `void` means it doesn't return anything. The `source?` indicates that it takes an optional `source` argument.


```md alert info
# Another way to use the AG Grid API
It is also possible to use the AG Grid API directly with the event trigger (`on_click`) of the component. This removes the need to create a variable `my_api`. This is shown in the example below. It is necessary to use the `id` of the `ag_grid` component that is to be referenced.

```python
rx.button("Select all", on_click=rxe.ag_grid.api(id="ag_grid_basic_row_selection").select_all()),
```

### More examples

The following example lets a user [export the data as a csv](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/grid-api/#reference-export-exportDataAsCsv) and [adjust the size of columns to fit the available horizontal space](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/grid-api/#reference-columnSizing-sizeColumnsToFit). (Try resizing the screen and then clicking the resize columns button)


```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(
    "data/gapminder2007.csv"
)

column_defs = [
    {"field": "country", "checkboxSelection": True},
    {"field": "pop"},
    {"field": "continent"},
]

def ag_grid_api_simple2():
    my_api = rxe.ag_grid.api(id="ag_grid_export_and_resize")
    return rx.vstack(
            rxe.ag_grid(
            id="ag_grid_export_and_resize",
            row_data=df.to_dict("records"),
            column_defs=column_defs,
            width="100%",
            height="40vh",
        ),
        rx.button("Export", on_click=my_api.export_data_as_csv()),
        rx.button("Resize Columns", on_click=my_api.size_columns_to_fit()),
        spacing="4",
        width="100%",
    )
```

📊 **Dataset source:** [gapminder2007.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminder2007.csv)

The react code for both of these is shown below. The key point to see is that both of these functions return `void` and therefore does not return anything.

`exportDataAsCsv = (params?: CsvExportParams) => void;`

`sizeColumnsToFit = (paramsOrGridWidth?: ISizeColumnsToFitParams  |  number) => void;`


### Example with a Return Value

This example shows how to get the data from `ag_grid` as a [csv on the backend](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/grid-api/#reference-export-getDataAsCsv). The data that was passed to the backend is then displayed as a toast with the data.

```python
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd

class AGGridStateAPI(rx.State):
    def handle_get_data(self, data: str):
        yield rx.toast(f"Got CSV data: {data}")

df = pd.read_csv(
    "data/gapminder2007.csv"
)

column_defs = [
    \{"field": "country", "checkboxSelection": True\},
    \{"field": "pop"\},
    \{"field": "continent"\},
]

def ag_grid_api_argument():
    my_api = rxe.ag_grid.api(id="ag_grid_get_data_as_csv")
    return rx.vstack(
        rxe.ag_grid(
            id="ag_grid_get_data_as_csv",
            row_data=df.to_dict("records"),
            column_defs=column_defs,
            width="100%",
            height="40vh",
        ),
        rx.button("Get CSV data on backend", on_click=my_api.get_data_as_csv(callback=AGGridStateAPI.handle_get_data)),
        spacing="4",
        width="100%",
    )
```

The react code for the `get_data_as_csv` method of the AG Grid API is `getDataAsCsv = (params?: CsvExportParams) => string  |  undefined;`. Here the function returns a `string` (or undefined).

In Reflex to handle this returned value it is necessary to pass a `callback` as an argument to the `get_data_as_csv` method that will get the returned value. In this example the `handle_get_data` event handler is passed as the callback. This event handler will be called with the returned value from the `get_data_as_csv` method.

# Column Definitions

## Basic Columns

AgGrid allows you to define the columns of your grid, passed to the prop `column_defs`. Each dictionary represents a column.

```md alert warning
# If you are converting from other AG Grid implementation, we also support camelCase for the name of the properties.
```

Here we define a grid with 3 columns:
```python
column_defs = [
    {"field": "direction"},
    {"field": "strength"},
    {"field": "frequency"},
]
```

To set default properties for all your columns, you can define `default_col_def` in your grid:
```python
default_col_def = {
    "sortable": True,
    "filter": True,
    "resizable": True,
}
```

A model wrapper is an utility used to wrap a database model and provide a consistent interface over it. It allows automatically adding new rows to the database, updating existing rows, and deleting rows.

## Default Model Wrapper

You can use the basic functionality of the model wrapper by using the `rxe.model_wrapper` function. This function takes a database model and returns a wrapper object that can be used to interact with the model.

```python
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

def index_page():
    return rxe.model_wrapper(class_model=MyModel)
```

By default the model_wrapper use the infinite rows model from AgGrid.

## Custom Model Wrapper

If the default model wrapper does not fit your needs, you can create a custom model wrapper by subclassing the `rxe.ModelWrapper` class. This allows you to customize the behavior of the model wrapper to fit your specific use case.

```python
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

class MyCustomWrapper(rxe.ModelWrapper[MyModel]):
   pass
```

In the custom model wrapper, you can override the following methods:
- `_get_columns_defs`
- `_get_data`
- `_row_count`
- `on_value_setter`

to modify how the model wrapper will behave.


## SSRM Model Wrapper

The SSRM model wrapper, used with `rxe.model_wrapper_ssrm`, is a version of the model wrapper that allows you to use the ServerSideRowModel of AgGrid.

```python
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

def index_page():
    return rxe.model_wrapper_ssrm(class_model=MyModel)
```

## SSRM Custom Model Wrapper

In the same way you can extend the default model wrapper, you can extend the SSRM custom model wrapper by subclassing the `rxe.ModelWrapperSSRM` class. This allows you to customize the behavior of the model wrapper to fit your specific use case.

```python
import reflex_enterprise as rxe

class MyCustomSSRMWrapper(rxe.ModelWrapperSSRM[MyModel]):
   pass
```

The overridable methods are the same as the standard model wrapper.

# Cell Selection

AG Grid provides powerful cell selection capabilities that allow users to select individual cells or ranges of cells. This feature is essential for data manipulation, copying, and advanced interactions like fill handle operations.

## Range Selection

To enable cell selection in your AG Grid, set the `cell_selection` prop to `True`. This automatically enables both single cell selection and range selection capabilities.

### Basic Selection Example

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd

class CellSelectionState(rx.State):
    data: list[dict] = []

    @rx.event
    def load_data(self):
        df = pd.read_json("https://www.ag-grid.com/example-assets/olympic-winners.json")
        self.data = df.head(10).to_dict("records")

    @rx.event
    def echo_selection(self, ranges: list[dict], started: bool, finished: bool):
        if finished:
            yield rx.toast(f"Selected ranges: {ranges}")

column_defs = [
    {"field": "athlete", "width": 150},
    {"field": "age", "width": 90},
    {"field": "country", "width": 120},
    {"field": "year", "width": 90},
    {"field": "sport", "width": 120},
    {"field": "gold", "width": 100},
    {"field": "silver", "width": 100},
    {"field": "bronze", "width": 100},
]

def basic_cell_selection():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text("Click and drag to select cells. Selection info will appear in a toast.", size="2"),
        rxe.ag_grid(
            id="basic_cell_selection_grid",
            column_defs=column_defs,
            row_data=CellSelectionState.data,
            cell_selection=True,
            on_cell_selection_changed=CellSelectionState.echo_selection,
            width="100%",
            height="400px",
        ),
        on_mount=CellSelectionState.load_data,
        width="100%",
    )
```

### Advanced Selection Event Handling

For more sophisticated selection handling, you can process the selection ranges to calculate detailed information:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd

class AdvancedSelectionState(rx.State):
    data: list[dict] = []

    @rx.event
    def load_data(self):
        df = pd.DataFrame({
            "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Eve"],
            "score": [85, 92, 78, 96, 88],
            "grade": ["B", "A", "C", "A", "B"],
            "attempts": [3, 2, 4, 1, 3]
        })
        self.data = df.to_dict("records")

    @rx.event
    def handle_selection(self, ranges: list[dict], started: bool, finished: bool):
        if finished and ranges:
            total_cells = sum(
                (r.get("endRow", 0) - r.get("startRow", 0) + 1) * 
                len(r.get("columns", []))
                for r in ranges
            )
            yield rx.toast(f"Selected {total_cells} cells across {len(ranges)} ranges")

editable_column_defs = [
    {"field": "name", "width": 120},
    {"field": "score", "width": 100, "editable": True},
    {"field": "grade", "width": 100, "editable": True},
    {"field": "attempts", "width": 120, "editable": True},
]

def advanced_selection_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text("Select ranges of cells. Try selecting multiple ranges by holding Ctrl/Cmd.", size="2"),
        rxe.ag_grid(
            id="advanced_selection_grid",
            column_defs=editable_column_defs,
            row_data=AdvancedSelectionState.data,
            cell_selection=True,
            on_cell_selection_changed=AdvancedSelectionState.handle_selection,
            width="100%",
            height="300px",
        ),
        on_mount=AdvancedSelectionState.load_data,
        width="100%",
    )
```

## Fill Handle

The fill handle is a powerful feature that allows users to quickly fill cells by dragging from a selected cell or range. When enabled, a small square appears at the bottom-right corner of the selection that users can drag to fill adjacent cells.

### Enabling Fill Handle

To enable the fill handle, configure the `cell_selection` prop with a dictionary containing the handle configuration:

```python
cell_selection={
    "handle": {
        "mode": "fill",  # Enable fill handle
    }
}
```

### Fill Handle Events

When using the fill handle, it will trigger `on_cell_value_changed` for each cell receiving a fill value. This allows your backend to handle the data changes appropriately.

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd

class FillHandleState(rx.State):
    data: list[dict] = []
    change_log: list[str] = []

    @rx.event
    def load_data(self):
        df = pd.DataFrame({
            "item": ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Elderberry"],
            "quantity": [10, 15, 8, 12, 20],
            "price": [1.50, 0.75, 2.00, 3.00, 4.50],
            "total": [15.00, 11.25, 16.00, 36.00, 90.00]
        })
        self.data = df.to_dict("records")

    @rx.event
    def handle_cell_change(self, data: dict):
        row_index = data.get("rowIndex", 0)
        field = data.get("colId", "")
        new_value = data.get("newValue", "")
        old_value = data.get("oldValue", "")
        
        change_msg = f"Row {row_index + 1}, {field}: '{old_value}' → '{new_value}'"
        self.change_log = [change_msg] + self.change_log[:9]  # Keep last 10 changes
        
        # Update the data
        if 0 <= row_index < len(self.data):
            self.data[row_index][field] = new_value

fill_column_defs = [
    {"field": "item", "width": 120},
    {"field": "quantity", "width": 100, "editable": True, "type": "numericColumn"},
    {"field": "price", "width": 100, "editable": True, "type": "numericColumn"},
    {"field": "total", "width": 100, "editable": True, "type": "numericColumn"},
]

def fill_handle_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text("Select a cell and drag the fill handle (small square at bottom-right) to fill adjacent cells.", size="2"),
        rxe.ag_grid(
            id="fill_handle_grid",
            column_defs=fill_column_defs,
            row_data=FillHandleState.data,
            cell_selection={
                "handle": {
                    "mode": "fill",  # Enable fill handle
                }
            },
            on_cell_value_changed=FillHandleState.handle_cell_change,
            width="100%",
            height="300px",
        ),
        rx.divider(),
        rx.text("Recent Changes:", weight="bold", size="3"),
        rx.cond(
            FillHandleState.change_log,
            rx.vstack(
                rx.foreach(
                    FillHandleState.change_log,
                    lambda change: rx.text(change, size="1", color="gray")
                ),
                spacing="1",
            ),
            rx.text("No changes yet", size="2", color="gray")
        ),
        on_mount=FillHandleState.load_data,
        width="100%",
        spacing="4",
    )
```

## Advanced Configuration Options

You can further customize cell selection behavior using additional configuration options:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx
import reflex_enterprise as rxe
import pandas as pd

class ConfigurationState(rx.State):
    data: list[dict] = []

    @rx.event
    def load_data(self):
        df = pd.DataFrame({
            "id": range(1, 8),
            "name": ["Product A", "Product B", "Product C", "Product D", "Product E", "Product F", "Product G"],
            "category": ["Electronics", "Clothing", "Electronics", "Books", "Clothing", "Electronics", "Books"],
            "price": [299.99, 49.99, 199.99, 24.99, 79.99, 399.99, 19.99],
            "stock": [15, 32, 8, 45, 23, 12, 67]
        })
        self.data = df.to_dict("records")

configuration_column_defs = [
    {"field": "id", "width": 80},
    {"field": "name", "width": 150, "editable": True},
    {"field": "category", "width": 120},
    {"field": "price", "width": 100, "editable": True, "type": "numericColumn"},
    {"field": "stock", "width": 100, "editable": True, "type": "numericColumn"},
]

def configuration_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text("Cell selection with additional configuration options", size="2"),
        rxe.ag_grid(
            id="configuration_grid",
            column_defs=configuration_column_defs,
            row_data=ConfigurationState.data,
            cell_selection={
                "handle": {
                    "mode": "fill",
                }
            },
            enable_cell_text_selection=True,  # Allow text selection within cells
            suppress_cell_focus=False,  # Allow cell focus
            width="100%",
            height="350px",
        ),
        on_mount=ConfigurationState.load_data,
        width="100%",
    )
```

## Key Features

- **Cell Selection**: Enable with `cell_selection=True` for both single cell and range selection capabilities
- **Fill Handle**: Configure with `cell_selection={"handle": {"mode": "fill"}}` for drag-to-fill functionality
- **Event Handling**: Use `on_cell_selection_changed` to respond to selection changes
- **Value Changes**: Use `on_cell_value_changed` to handle individual cell edits and fill operations
- **Text Selection**: Enable `enable_cell_text_selection=True` to allow text selection within cells

## Best Practices

1. **Use cell_selection configuration**: Both single cell and range selection are automatically enabled with `cell_selection=True`, providing all necessary selection capabilities for fill operations.

2. **Handle cell value changes**: When using fill handle, implement `on_cell_value_changed` to process the data updates in your backend.

3. **Provide user feedback**: Use toasts or other UI elements to confirm selection actions and data changes.

4. **Consider performance**: For large datasets, be mindful of the performance impact of frequent cell value change events.

5. **Validate fill operations**: Implement validation logic in your `on_cell_value_changed` handler to ensure data integrity.


# Queries

Queries are used to retrieve data from a database.

A query is a request for information from a database table or combination of
tables. A query can be used to retrieve data from a single table or multiple
tables. A query can also be used to insert, update, or delete data from a table.

## Session

To execute a query you must first create a `rx.session`. You can use the session
to query the database using SQLModel or SQLAlchemy syntax.

The `rx.session` statement will automatically close the session when the code
block is finished. **If `session.commit()` is not called, the changes will be
rolled back and not persisted to the database.** The code can also explicitly
rollback without closing the session via `session.rollback()`.

The following example shows how to create a session and query the database.
First we create a table called `User`.

```python
class User(rx.Model, table=True):
    username: str
    email: str
```

### Select

Then we create a session and query the User table.

```python
class QueryUser(rx.State):
    name: str
    users: list[User]

    @rx.event
    def get_users(self):
        with rx.session() as session:
            self.users = session.exec(
                User.select().where(
                    User.username.contains(self.name))).all()
```

The `get_users` method will query the database for all users that contain the
value of the state var `name`.

### Insert

Similarly, the `session.add()` method to add a new record to the
database or persist an existing object.

```python
class AddUser(rx.State):
    username: str
    email: str
    
    @rx.event
    def add_user(self):
        with rx.session() as session:
            session.add(User(username=self.username, email=self.email))
            session.commit()
```

### Update

To update the user, first query the database for the object, make the desired
modifications, `.add` the object to the session and finally call `.commit()`.

```python
class ChangeEmail(rx.State):
    username: str
    email: str

    @rx.event
    def modify_user(self):
        with rx.session() as session:
            user = session.exec(User.select().where(
                (User.username == self.username))).first()
            user.email = self.email
            session.add(user)
            session.commit()
```

### Delete

To delete a user, first query the database for the object, then call
`.delete()` on the session and finally call `.commit()`.

```python
class RemoveUser(rx.State):
    username: str

    @rx.event
    def delete_user(self):
        with rx.session() as session:
            user = session.exec(User.select().where(
                User.username == self.username)).first()
            session.delete(user)
            session.commit()
```

## ORM Object Lifecycle

The objects returned by queries are bound to the session that created them, and cannot generally
be used outside that session. After adding or updating an object, not all fields are automatically
updated, so accessing certain attributes may trigger additional queries to refresh the object.

To avoid this, the `session.refresh()` method can be used to update the object explicitly and
ensure all fields are up to date before exiting the session.

```python
class AddUserForm(rx.State):
    user: User | None = None
    
    @rx.event
    def add_user(self, form_data: dict[str, Any]):
        with rx.session() as session:
            self.user = User(**form_data)
            session.add(self.user)
            session.commit()
            session.refresh(self.user)
```

Now the `self.user` object will have a correct reference to the autogenerated
primary key, `id`, even though this was not provided when the object was created
from the form data.

If `self.user` needs to be modified or used in another query in a new session,
it must be added to the session. Adding an object to a session does not
necessarily create the object, but rather associates it with a session where it
may either be created or updated accordingly.

```python
class AddUserForm(rx.State):
    ...
    
    @rx.event
    def update_user(self, form_data: dict[str, Any]):
        if self.user is None:
            return
        with rx.session() as session:
            self.user.set(**form_data)
            session.add(self.user)
            session.commit()
            session.refresh(self.user)
```

If an ORM object will be referenced and accessed outside of a session, you
should call `.refresh()` on it to avoid stale object exceptions.

## Using SQL Directly

Avoiding SQL is one of the main benefits of using an ORM, but sometimes it is
necessary for particularly complex queries, or when using database-specific
features.

SQLModel exposes the `session.execute()` method that can be used to execute raw
SQL strings.  If parameter binding is needed, the query may be wrapped in
[`sqlalchemy.text`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/sqlelement.html#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.text),
which allows colon-prefix names to be used as placeholders.

```md alert info
# Never use string formatting to construct SQL queries, as this may lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities in the app.
```

```python
import sqlalchemy

import reflex as rx


class State(rx.State):

    @rx.event
    def insert_user_raw(self, username, email):
        with rx.session() as session:
            session.execute(
                sqlalchemy.text(
                    "INSERT INTO user (username, email) "
                    "VALUES (:username, :email)"
                ),
                \{"username": username, "email": email},
            )
            session.commit()

    @rx.var
    def raw_user_tuples(self) -> list[list]:
        with rx.session() as session:
            return [list(row) for row in session.execute("SELECT * FROM user").all()]
```

## Async Database Operations

Reflex provides an async version of the session function called `rx.asession` for asynchronous database operations. This is useful when you need to perform database operations in an async context, such as within async event handlers.

The `rx.asession` function returns an async SQLAlchemy session that must be used with an async context manager. Most operations against the `asession` must be awaited.

```python
import sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio
import sqlalchemy

import reflex as rx


class AsyncUserState(rx.State):
    users: list[User] = []
    
    @rx.event(background=True)
    async def get_users_async(self):
        async with rx.asession() as asession:
            result = await asession.execute(User.select())
            async with self:
                self.users = result.all()
```

### Async Select

The following example shows how to query the database asynchronously:

```python
class AsyncQueryUser(rx.State):
    name: str
    users: list[User] = []

    @rx.event(background=True)
    async def get_users(self):
        async with rx.asession() as asession:
            stmt = User.select().where(User.username.contains(self.name))
            result = await asession.execute(stmt)
            async with self:
                self.users = result.all()
```

### Async Insert

To add a new record to the database asynchronously:

```python
class AsyncAddUser(rx.State):
    username: str
    email: str
    
    @rx.event(background=True)
    async def add_user(self):
        async with rx.asession() as asession:
            asession.add(User(username=self.username, email=self.email))
            await asession.commit()
```

### Async Update

To update a user asynchronously:

```python
class AsyncChangeEmail(rx.State):
    username: str
    email: str

    @rx.event(background=True)
    async def modify_user(self):
        async with rx.asession() as asession:
            stmt = User.select().where(User.username == self.username)
            result = await asession.execute(stmt)
            user = result.first()
            if user:
                user.email = self.email
                asession.add(user)
                await asession.commit()
```

### Async Delete

To delete a user asynchronously:

```python
class AsyncRemoveUser(rx.State):
    username: str

    @rx.event(background=True)
    async def delete_user(self):
        async with rx.asession() as asession:
            stmt = User.select().where(User.username == self.username)
            result = await asession.execute(stmt)
            user = result.first()
            if user:
                await asession.delete(user)
                await asession.commit()
```

### Async Refresh

Similar to the regular session, you can refresh an object to ensure all fields are up to date:

```python
class AsyncAddUserForm(rx.State):
    user: User | None = None
    
    @rx.event(background=True)
    async def add_user(self, form_data: dict[str, str]):
        async with rx.asession() as asession:
            async with self:
                self.user = User(**form_data)
            asession.add(self.user)
            await asession.commit()
            await asession.refresh(self.user)
```

### Async SQL Execution

You can also execute raw SQL asynchronously:

```python
class AsyncRawSQL(rx.State):
    users: list[list] = []
    
    @rx.event(background=True)
    async def insert_user_raw(self, username, email):
        async with rx.asession() as asession:
            await asession.execute(
                sqlalchemy.text(
                    "INSERT INTO user (username, email) "
                    "VALUES (:username, :email)"
                ),
                dict(username=username, email=email),
            )
            await asession.commit()
    
    @rx.event(background=True)
    async def get_raw_users(self):
        async with rx.asession() as asession:
            result = await asession.execute("SELECT * FROM user")
            async with self:
                self.users = [list(row) for row in result.all()]
```

```md alert info
# Important Notes for Async Database Operations
- Always use the `@rx.event(background=True)` decorator for async event handlers
- Most operations against the `asession` must be awaited, including `commit()`, `execute()`, `refresh()`, and `delete()`
- The `add()` method does not need to be awaited
- Result objects from queries have methods like `all()` and `first()` that are synchronous and return data directly
- Use `async with self:` when updating state variables in background tasks
```


# Tables

Tables are database objects that contain all the data in a database.

In tables, data is logically organized in a row-and-column format similar to a
spreadsheet. Each row represents a unique record, and each column represents a
field in the record.

## Creating a Table

To create a table, make a class that inherits from `rx.Model`.

The following example shows how to create a table called `User`.

```python
class User(rx.Model, table=True):
    username: str
    email: str
```

The `table=True` argument tells Reflex to create a table in the database for
this class.

### Primary Key

By default, Reflex will create a primary key column called `id` for each table.

However, if an `rx.Model` defines a different field with `primary_key=True`, then the
default `id` field will not be created. A table may also redefine `id` as needed.

It is not currently possible to create a table without a primary key.

## Advanced Column Types

SQLModel automatically maps basic python types to SQLAlchemy column types, but
for more advanced use cases, it is possible to define the column type using
`sqlalchemy` directly. For example, we can add a last updated timestamp to the
post example as a proper `DateTime` field with timezone.

```python
import datetime

import sqlmodel
import sqlalchemy

class Post(rx.Model, table=True):
    ...
    update_ts: datetime.datetime = sqlmodel.Field(
        default=None,
        sa_column=sqlalchemy.Column(
            "update_ts",
            sqlalchemy.DateTime(timezone=True),
            server_default=sqlalchemy.func.now(),
        ),
    )
```

To make the `Post` model more usable on the frontend, a `dict` method may be provided
that converts any fields to a JSON serializable value. In this case, the dict method is
overriding the default `datetime` serializer to strip off the microsecond part.

```python
class Post(rx.Model, table=True):
    ...

    def dict(self, *args, **kwargs) -> dict:
        d = super().dict(*args, **kwargs)
        d["update_ts"] = self.update_ts.replace(microsecond=0).isoformat()
        return d
```


# Database

Reflex uses [sqlmodel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com) to provide a built-in ORM wrapping SQLAlchemy.

The examples on this page refer specifically to how Reflex uses various tools to
expose an integrated database interface.  Only basic use cases will be covered
below, but you can refer to the
[sqlmodel tutorial](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/tutorial/select/)
for more examples and information, just replace `SQLModel` with `rx.Model` and
`Session(engine)` with `rx.session()`

For advanced use cases, please see the
[SQLAlchemy docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/quickstart.html) (v1.4).

```md alert info
# Using NoSQL Databases

If you are using a NoSQL database (e.g. MongoDB), you can work with it in Reflex by installing the appropriate Python client library. In this case, Reflex will not provide any ORM features.
```

## Connecting

Reflex provides a built-in SQLite database for storing and retrieving data.

You can connect to your own SQL compatible database by modifying the
`rxconfig.py` file with your database url.

```python
config = rx.Config(
    app_name="my_app",
    db_url="sqlite:///reflex.db",
)
```

For more examples of database URLs that can be used, see the [SQLAlchemy
docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html#backend-specific-urls).
Be sure to install the appropriate DBAPI driver for the database you intend to
use.

## Tables

To create a table make a class that inherits from `rx.Model` with and specify
that it is a table.

```python
class User(rx.Model, table=True):
    username: str
    email: str
    password: str   
```

## Migrations

Reflex leverages [alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/)
to manage database schema changes.

Before the database feature can be used in a new app you must call `reflex db init`
to initialize alembic and create a migration script with the current schema.

After making changes to the schema, use
`reflex db makemigrations --message 'something changed'`
to generate a script in the `alembic/versions` directory that will update the
database schema.  It is recommended that generated scripts be inspected before applying them.

Bear in mind that your newest models will not be detected by the `reflex db makemigrations`
command unless imported and used somewhere within the application.

The `reflex db migrate` command is used to apply migration scripts to bring the
database up to date. During app startup, if Reflex detects that the current
database schema is not up to date, a warning will be displayed on the console.

## Queries

To query the database you can create a `rx.session()`
which handles opening and closing the database connection.

You can use normal SQLAlchemy queries to query the database.

```python
with rx.session() as session:
    session.add(User(username="test", email="admin@reflex.dev", password="admin"))
    session.commit()
```

# Relationships

Foreign key relationships are used to link two tables together. For example,
the `Post` model may have a field, `user_id`, with a foreign key of `user.id`,
referencing a `User` model. This would allow us to automatically query the `Post` objects
associated with a user, or find the `User` object associated with a `Post`.

To establish bidirectional relationships a model must correctly set the
`back_populates` keyword argument on the `Relationship` to the relationship
attribute in the _other_ model.

## Foreign Key Relationships

To create a relationship, first add a field to the model that references the
primary key of the related table, then add a `sqlmodel.Relationship` attribute
which can be used to access the related objects.

Defining relationships like this requires the use of `sqlmodel` objects as
seen in the example.

```python
from typing import List, Optional

import sqlmodel

import reflex as rx


class Post(rx.Model, table=True):
    title: str
    body: str
    user_id: int = sqlmodel.Field(foreign_key="user.id")

    user: Optional["User"] = sqlmodel.Relationship(back_populates="posts")
    flags: Optional[List["Flag"]] = sqlmodel.Relationship(back_populates="post")


class User(rx.Model, table=True):
    username: str
    email: str

    posts: List[Post] = sqlmodel.Relationship(back_populates="user")
    flags: List["Flag"] = sqlmodel.Relationship(back_populates="user")


class Flag(rx.Model, table=True):
    post_id: int = sqlmodel.Field(foreign_key="post.id")
    user_id: int = sqlmodel.Field(foreign_key="user.id")
    message: str

    post: Optional[Post] = sqlmodel.Relationship(back_populates="flags")
    user: Optional[User] = sqlmodel.Relationship(back_populates="flags")
```

See the [SQLModel Relationship Docs](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/tutorial/relationship-attributes/define-relationships-attributes/) for more details.

## Querying Relationships

### Inserting Linked Objects

The following example assumes that the flagging user is stored in the state as a
`User` instance and that the post `id` is provided in the data submitted in the
form.

```python
class FlagPostForm(rx.State):
    user: User

    @rx.event
    def flag_post(self, form_data: dict[str, Any]):
        with rx.session() as session:
            post = session.get(Post, int(form_data.pop("post_id")))
            flag = Flag(message=form_data.pop("message"), post=post, user=self.user)
            session.add(flag)
            session.commit()
```

### How are Relationships Dereferenced?

By default, the relationship attributes are in **lazy loading** or `"select"`
mode, which generates a query _on access_ to the relationship attribute. Lazy
loading is generally fine for single object lookups and manipulation, but can be
inefficient when accessing many linked objects for serialization purposes.

There are several alternative loading mechanisms available that can be set on
the relationship object or when performing the query.

* "joined" or `joinload` - generates a single query to load all related objects
  at once.
* "subquery" or `subqueryload` - generates a single query to load all related
  objects at once, but uses a subquery to do the join, instead of a join in the
  main query.
* "selectin" or `selectinload` - emits a second (or more) SELECT statement which
  assembles the primary key identifiers of the parent objects into an IN clause,
  so that all members of related collections / scalar references are loaded at
  once by primary key

There are also non-loading mechanisms, "raise" and "noload" which are used to
specifically avoid loading a relationship.

Each loading method comes with tradeoffs and some are better suited for different
data access patterns.
See [SQLAlchemy: Relationship Loading Techniques](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/loading_relationships.html)
for more detail.

### Querying Linked Objects

To query the `Post` table and include all `User` and `Flag` objects up front,
the `.options` interface will be used to specify `selectinload` for the required
relationships. Using this method, the linked objects will be available for
rendering in frontend code without additional steps.

```python
import sqlalchemy


class PostState(rx.State):
    posts: List[Post]

    @rx.event
    def load_posts(self):
        with rx.session() as session:
            self.posts = session.exec(
                Post.select
                .options(
                    sqlalchemy.orm.selectinload(Post.user),
                    sqlalchemy.orm.selectinload(Post.flags).options(
                        sqlalchemy.orm.selectinload(Flag.user),
                    ),
                )
                .limit(15)
            ).all()
```

The loading methods create new query objects and thus may be linked if the
relationship itself has other relationships that need to be loaded. In this
example, since `Flag` references `User`, the `Flag.user` relationship must be
chain loaded from the `Post.flags` relationship.

### Specifying the Loading Mechanism on the Relationship

Alternatively, the loading mechanism can be specified on the relationship by
passing `sa_relationship_kwargs=\{"lazy": method}` to `sqlmodel.Relationship`,
which will use the given loading mechanism in all queries by default.

```python
from typing import List, Optional

import sqlmodel

import reflex as rx


class Post(rx.Model, table=True):
    ...
    user: Optional["User"] = sqlmodel.Relationship(
        back_populates="posts",
        sa_relationship_kwargs=\{"lazy": "selectin"},
    )
    flags: Optional[List["Flag"]] = sqlmodel.Relationship(
        back_populates="post",
        sa_relationship_kwargs=\{"lazy": "selectin"},
    )
```


```python exec
import random
import time

import numpy as np

import reflex as rx

from pcweb.templates.docpage import docpage
```

# Var Operations

Var operations transform the placeholder representation of the value on the
frontend and provide a way to perform basic operations on the Var without having
to define a computed var.

Within your frontend components, you cannot use arbitrary Python functions on
the state vars. For example, the following code will **not work.**

```python
class State(rx.State):
    number: int

def index():
    # This will be compiled before runtime, before `State.number` has a known value.
    # Since `float` is not a valid var operation, this will throw an error.
    rx.text(float(State.number))
```

This is because we compile the frontend to Javascript, but the value of `State.number`
is only known at runtime.

In this example below we use a var operation to concatenate a `string` with a `var`, meaning we do not have to do in within state as a computed var.

```python demo exec
coins = ["BTC", "ETH", "LTC", "DOGE"]

class VarSelectState(rx.State):
    selected: str = "DOGE"

    def set_selected(self, value: str):
        self.selected = value

def var_operations_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        # Using a var operation to concatenate a string with a var.
        rx.heading("I just bought a bunch of " + VarSelectState.selected),
        # Using an f-string to interpolate a var.
        rx.text(f"{VarSelectState.selected} is going to the moon!"),
        rx.select(
            coins,
            value=VarSelectState.selected,
            on_change=VarSelectState.set_selected,
        )
    )
```

```md alert success
# Vars support many common operations.

They can be used for arithmetic, string concatenation, inequalities, indexing, and more. See the [full list of supported operations](/docs/api-reference/var/).
```

## Supported Operations

Var operations allow us to change vars on the front-end without having to create more computed vars on the back-end in the state.

Some simple examples are the `==` var operator, which is used to check if two vars are equal and the `to_string()` var operator, which is used to convert a var to a string.

```python demo exec

fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango"]

class EqualsState(rx.State):
    selected: str = "Apple"
    favorite: str = "Banana"

    def set_selected(self, value: str):
        self.selected = value


def var_equals_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text(EqualsState.favorite.to_string() + " is my favorite fruit!"),
        rx.select(
            fruits,
            value=EqualsState.selected,
            on_change=EqualsState.set_selected,
        ),
        rx.cond(
            EqualsState.selected == EqualsState.favorite,
            rx.text("The selected fruit is equal to the favorite fruit!"),
            rx.text("The selected fruit is not equal to the favorite fruit."),
        ),
    )

```

### Negate, Absolute and Length

The `-` operator is used to get the negative version of the var. The `abs()` operator is used to get the absolute value of the var. The `.length()` operator is used to get the length of a list var.

```python demo exec
import random

class OperState(rx.State):
    number: int
    numbers_seen: list = []

    @rx.event
    def update(self):
        self.number = random.randint(-100, 100)
        self.numbers_seen.append(self.number)

def var_operation_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(f"The number: {OperState.number}", size="3"),
        rx.hstack(
            rx.text("Negated:", rx.badge(-OperState.number, variant="soft", color_scheme="green")),
            rx.text(f"Absolute:", rx.badge(abs(OperState.number), variant="soft", color_scheme="blue")),
            rx.text(f"Numbers seen:", rx.badge(OperState.numbers_seen.length(), variant="soft", color_scheme="red")),
        ),
        rx.button("Update", on_click=OperState.update),
    )
```

### Comparisons and Mathematical Operators

All of the comparison operators are used as expected in python. These include `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`.

There are operators to add two vars `+`, subtract two vars `-`, multiply two vars `*` and raise a var to a power `pow()`.

```python demo exec
import random

class CompState(rx.State):
    number_1: int
    number_2: int

    @rx.event
    def update(self):
        self.number_1 = random.randint(-10, 10)
        self.number_2 = random.randint(-10, 10)

def var_comparison_example():

    return rx.vstack(
                rx.table.root(
            rx.table.header(
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Integer 1"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Integer 2"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Operation"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Outcome"),
                ),
            ),
            rx.table.body(
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.row_header_cell(CompState.number_1),
                    rx.table.cell(CompState.number_2),
                    rx.table.cell("Int 1 == Int 2"),
                    rx.table.cell((CompState.number_1 == CompState.number_2).to_string()),
                ),
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.row_header_cell(CompState.number_1),
                    rx.table.cell(CompState.number_2),
                    rx.table.cell("Int 1 != Int 2"),
                    rx.table.cell((CompState.number_1 != CompState.number_2).to_string()),
                ),

                    rx.table.cell((CompState.number_1 > CompState.number_2).to_string()),
                ),

                    rx.table.row_header_cell(CompState.number_1),

                    rx.table.cell("Int 1 >= Int 2"),
                    rx.table.cell((CompState.number_1 >= CompState.number_2).to_string()),
                ),

                    rx.table.cell("Int 1 <= Int 2"),
                    rx.table.cell((CompState.number_1 <= CompState.number_2).to_string()),

            width="100%",
        ),
        rx.button("Update", on_click=CompState.update),
    )
```

### True Division, Floor Division and Remainder

The operator `/` represents true division. The operator `//` represents floor division. The operator `%` represents the remainder of the division.

```python demo exec
import random

class DivState(rx.State):
    number_1: float = 3.5
    number_2: float = 1.4

    @rx.event
    def update(self):
        self.number_1 = round(random.uniform(5.1, 9.9), 2)
        self.number_2 = round(random.uniform(0.1, 4.9), 2)

def var_div_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.table.root(
            rx.table.header(
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Integer 1"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Integer 2"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Operation"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Outcome"),
                ),
            ),
            rx.table.body(
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.row_header_cell(DivState.number_1),
                    rx.table.cell(DivState.number_2),
                    rx.table.cell("Int 1 / Int 2"),
                    rx.table.cell(f"{DivState.number_1 / DivState.number_2}"),
                ),
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.row_header_cell(DivState.number_1),
                    rx.table.cell(DivState.number_2),
                    rx.table.cell("Int 1 // Int 2"),
                    rx.table.cell(f"{DivState.number_1 // DivState.number_2}"),
                ),
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.row_header_cell(DivState.number_1),
                    rx.table.cell(DivState.number_2),
                    rx.table.cell("Int 1 % Int 2"),
                    rx.table.cell(f"{DivState.number_1 % DivState.number_2}"),
                ),
            ),
            width="100%",
        ),
        rx.button("Update", on_click=DivState.update),
    )
```

### And, Or and Not

In Reflex the `&` operator represents the logical AND when used in the front end. This means that it returns true only when both conditions are true simultaneously.
The `|` operator represents the logical OR when used in the front end. This means that it returns true when either one or both conditions are true.
The `~` operator is used to invert a var. It is used on a var of type `bool` and is equivalent to the `not` operator.

```python demo exec
import random

class LogicState(rx.State):
    var_1: bool = True
    var_2: bool = True

    @rx.event
    def update(self):
        self.var_1 = random.choice([True, False])
        self.var_2 = random.choice([True, False])

def var_logical_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.table.root(
            rx.table.header(
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Var 1"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Var 2"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Operation"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Outcome"),
                ),
            ),
            rx.table.body(
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.row_header_cell(LogicState.var_1.to_string()),
                    rx.table.cell(LogicState.var_2.to_string()),
                    rx.table.cell("Logical AND (&)"),
                    rx.table.cell((LogicState.var_1 & LogicState.var_2).to_string()),
                ),
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.row_header_cell(LogicState.var_1.to_string()),
                    rx.table.cell(LogicState.var_2.to_string()),
                    rx.table.cell("Logical OR (|)"),
                    rx.table.cell((LogicState.var_1 | LogicState.var_2).to_string()),
                ),
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.row_header_cell(LogicState.var_1.to_string()),
                    rx.table.cell(LogicState.var_2.to_string()),
                    rx.table.cell("The invert of Var 1 (~)"),
                    rx.table.cell((~LogicState.var_1).to_string()),
                ),

            ),
            width="100%",
        ),
        rx.button("Update", on_click=LogicState.update),
    )
```

### Contains, Reverse and Join

The 'in' operator is not supported for Var types, we must use the `Var.contains()` instead. When we use `contains`, the var must be of type: `dict`, `list`, `tuple` or `str`.
`contains` checks if a var contains the object that we pass to it as an argument.

We use the `reverse` operation to reverse a list var. The var must be of type `list`.

Finally we use the `join` operation to join a list var into a string.

```python demo exec
class ListsState(rx.State):
    list_1: list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
    list_2: list = [7, 8, 9, 10]
    list_3: list = ["p","y","t","h","o","n"]

def var_list_example():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.vstack(
            rx.heading(f"List 1: {ListsState.list_1}", size="3"),
            rx.text(f"List 1 Contains 3: {ListsState.list_1.contains(3)}"),
        ),
        rx.vstack(
            rx.heading(f"List 2: {ListsState.list_2}", size="3"),
            rx.text(f"Reverse List 2: {ListsState.list_2.reverse()}"),
        ),
        rx.vstack(
            rx.heading(f"List 3: {ListsState.list_3}", size="3"),
            rx.text(f"List 3 Joins: {ListsState.list_3.join()}"),
        ),
    )
```

### Lower, Upper, Split

The `lower` operator converts a string var to lowercase. The `upper` operator converts a string var to uppercase. The `split` operator splits a string var into a list.

```python demo exec
class StringState(rx.State):
    string_1: str = "PYTHON is FUN"
    string_2: str = "react is hard"


def var_string_example():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.vstack(
            rx.heading(f"List 1: {StringState.string_1}", size="3"),
            rx.text(f"List 1 Lower Case: {StringState.string_1.lower()}"),
        ),
        rx.vstack(
            rx.heading(f"List 2: {StringState.string_2}", size="3"),
            rx.text(f"List 2 Upper Case: {StringState.string_2.upper()}"),
            rx.text(f"Split String 2: {StringState.string_2.split()}"),
        ),
    )
```

## Get Item (Indexing)

Indexing is only supported for strings, lists, tuples, dicts, and dataframes. To index into a state var strict type annotations are required.

```python
class GetItemState1(rx.State):
    list_1: list = [50, 10, 20]

def get_item_error_1():
    return rx.progress(value=GetItemState1.list_1[0])
```

In the code above you would expect to index into the first index of the list_1 state var. In fact the code above throws the error: `Invalid var passed for prop value, expected type <class 'int'>, got value of type typing.Any.` This is because the type of the items inside the list have not been clearly defined in the state. To fix this you change the list_1 definition to `list_1: list[int] = [50, 10, 20]`

```python demo exec
class GetItemState1(rx.State):
    list_1: list[int] = [50, 10, 20]

def get_item_error_1():
    return rx.progress(value=GetItemState1.list_1[0])
```

### Using with Foreach

Errors frequently occur when using indexing and `foreach`.

```python
class ProjectsState(rx.State):
    projects: List[dict] = [
        {
            "technologies": ["Next.js", "Prisma", "Tailwind", "Google Cloud", "Docker", "MySQL"]
        },
        {
            "technologies": ["Python", "Flask", "Google Cloud", "Docker"]
        }
    ]

def get_badge(technology: str) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.badge(technology, variant="soft", color_scheme="green")

def project_item(project: dict):
    return rx.box(
        rx.hstack(
            rx.foreach(project["technologies"], get_badge)
        ),
    )

def failing_projects_example() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.box(rx.foreach(ProjectsState.projects, project_item))
```

The code above throws the error `TypeError: Could not foreach over var of type Any. (If you are trying to foreach over a state var, add a type annotation to the var.)`

We must change `projects: list[dict]` => `projects: list[dict[str, list]]` because while projects is annotated, the item in project["technologies"] is not.

```python demo exec
class ProjectsState(rx.State):
    projects: list[dict[str, list]] = [
        {
            "technologies": ["Next.js", "Prisma", "Tailwind", "Google Cloud", "Docker", "MySQL"]
        },
        {
            "technologies": ["Python", "Flask", "Google Cloud", "Docker"]
        }
    ]


def projects_example() -> rx.Component:
    def get_badge(technology: str) -> rx.Component:
        return rx.badge(technology, variant="soft", color_scheme="green")

    def project_item(project: dict) -> rx.Component:

        return rx.box(
            rx.hstack(
                rx.foreach(project["technologies"], get_badge)
            ),
        )
    return rx.box(rx.foreach(ProjectsState.projects, project_item))
```

The previous example had only a single type for each of the dictionaries `keys` and `values`. For complex multi-type data, you need to use a dataclass, as shown below.

```python demo exec
import dataclasses

@dataclasses.dataclass
class ActressType:
    actress_name: str
    age: int
    pages: list[dict[str, str]]

class MultiDataTypeState(rx.State):
    """The app state."""
    actresses: list[ActressType] = [
        ActressType(
            actress_name="Ariana Grande",
            age=30,
            pages=[
                {"url": "arianagrande.com"}, {"url": "https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande"}
            ]
        ),
        ActressType(
            actress_name="Gal Gadot",
            age=38,
            pages=[
                {"url": "http://www.galgadot.com/"}, {"url": "https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal_Gadot"}
            ]
        )
    ]

def actresses_example() -> rx.Component:
    def showpage(page: dict[str, str]):
        return rx.vstack(
            rx.text(page["url"]),
        )

    def showlist(item: ActressType):
        return rx.vstack(
            rx.hstack(
                rx.text(item.actress_name),
                rx.text(item.age),
            ),
            rx.foreach(item.pages, showpage),
        )
    return rx.box(rx.foreach(MultiDataTypeState.actresses, showlist))

```

Setting the type of `actresses` to be `actresses: list[dict[str,str]]` would fail as it cannot be understood that the `value` for the `pages key` is actually a `list`.

## Combine Multiple Var Operations

You can also combine multiple var operations together, as seen in the next example.

```python demo exec
import random

class VarNumberState(rx.State):
    number: int

    @rx.event
    def update(self):
        self.number = random.randint(0, 100)

def var_number_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(f"The number is {VarNumberState.number}", size="5"),
        # Var operations can be composed for more complex expressions.
        rx.cond(
            VarNumberState.number % 2 == 0,
            rx.text("Even", color="green"),
            rx.text("Odd", color="red"),
        ),
        rx.button("Update", on_click=VarNumberState.update),
    )
```

We could have made a computed var that returns the parity of `number`, but
it can be simpler just to use a var operation instead.

Var operations may be generally chained to make compound expressions, however
some complex transformations not supported by var operations must use computed vars
to calculate the value on the backend.


```python exec
import random
import time
import asyncio

import reflex as rx
```

# Computed Vars

Computed vars have values derived from other properties on the backend. They are
defined as methods in your State class with the `@rx.var` decorator.

Try typing in the input box and clicking out.

```python demo exec id=upper
class UppercaseState(rx.State):
    text: str = "hello"

    def set_text(self, value: str):
        self.text = value

    @rx.var
    def upper_text(self) -> str:
        # This will be recomputed whenever `text` changes.
        return self.text.upper()


def uppercase_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(UppercaseState.upper_text),
        rx.input(on_blur=UppercaseState.set_text, placeholder="Type here..."),
    )
```

Here, `upper_text` is a computed var that always holds the upper case version of `text`.

We recommend always using type annotations for computed vars.

## Cached Vars

By default, all computed vars are cached (`cache=True`). A cached var is only 
recomputed when the other state vars it depends on change. This is useful for 
expensive computations, but in some cases it may not update when you expect it to.

To create a computed var that recomputes on every state update regardless of 
dependencies, use `@rx.var(cache=False)`.

Previous versions of Reflex had a `@rx.cached_var` decorator, which is now replaced
by the `cache` argument of `@rx.var` (which defaults to `True`).

```python demo exec
class CachedVarState(rx.State):
    counter_a: int = 0
    counter_b: int = 0

    @rx.var(cache=False)
    def last_touch_time(self) -> str:
        # This is updated anytime the state is updated.
        return time.strftime("%H:%M:%S")

    @rx.event
    def increment_a(self):
        self.counter_a += 1

    @rx.var(cache=True)
    def last_counter_a_update(self) -> str:
        # This is updated only when `counter_a` changes.
        return f"{self.counter_a} at {time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}"

    @rx.event
    def increment_b(self):
        self.counter_b += 1

    @rx.var(cache=True)
    def last_counter_b_update(self) -> str:
        # This is updated only when `counter_b` changes.
        return f"{self.counter_b} at {time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}"


def cached_var_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text(f"State touched at: {CachedVarState.last_touch_time}"),
        rx.text(f"Counter A: {CachedVarState.last_counter_a_update}"),
        rx.text(f"Counter B: {CachedVarState.last_counter_b_update}"),
        rx.hstack(
            rx.button("Increment A", on_click=CachedVarState.increment_a),
            rx.button("Increment B", on_click=CachedVarState.increment_b),
        ),
    )
```

In this example `last_touch_time` uses `cache=False` to ensure it updates any
time the state is modified. `last_counter_a_update` is a cached computed var (using
the default `cache=True`) that only depends on `counter_a`, so it only gets recomputed 
when `counter_a` changes. Similarly `last_counter_b_update` only depends on `counter_b`, 
and thus is updated only when `counter_b` changes.

## Async Computed Vars

Async computed vars allow you to use asynchronous operations in your computed vars.
They are defined as async methods in your State class with the same `@rx.var` decorator.
Async computed vars are useful for operations that require asynchronous processing, such as:

- Fetching data from external APIs
- Database operations
- File I/O operations
- Any other operations that benefit from async/await

```python demo exec
class AsyncVarState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0

    @rx.var
    async def delayed_count(self) -> int:
        # Simulate an async operation like an API call
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        return self.count * 2

    @rx.event
    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1


def async_var_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading("Async Computed Var Example"),
        rx.text(f"Count: {AsyncVarState.count}"),
        rx.text(f"Delayed count (x2): {AsyncVarState.delayed_count}"),
        rx.button("Increment", on_click=AsyncVarState.increment),
        spacing="4",
    )
```

In this example, `delayed_count` is an async computed var that returns the count multiplied by 2 after a simulated delay.
When the count changes, the async computed var is automatically recomputed.

### Caching Async Computed Vars

Just like regular computed vars, async computed vars can also be cached. This is especially
useful for expensive async operations like API calls or database queries.

```python demo exec
class AsyncCachedVarState(rx.State):
    user_id: int = 1
    refresh_trigger: int = 0

    @rx.var(cache=True)
    async def user_data(self) -> dict:
        # In a real app, this would be an API call
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate network delay

        # Simulate different user data based on user_id
        users = {
            1: {"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"},
            2: {"name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com"},
            3: {"name": "Charlie", "email": "charlie@example.com"},
        }

        return users.get(self.user_id, {"name": "Unknown", "email": "unknown"})

    @rx.event
    def change_user(self):
        # Cycle through users 1-3
        self.user_id = (self.user_id % 3) + 1

    @rx.event
    def force_refresh(self):
        # This will not affect user_data dependencies, but will trigger a state update
        self.refresh_trigger += 1


def async_cached_var_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading("Cached Async Computed Var Example"),
        rx.text(f"User ID: {AsyncCachedVarState.user_id}"),
        rx.text(f"User Name: {AsyncCachedVarState.user_data['name']}"),
        rx.text(f"User Email: {AsyncCachedVarState.user_data['email']}"),
        rx.hstack(
            rx.button("Change User", on_click=AsyncCachedVarState.change_user),
            rx.button("Force Refresh (No Effect)", on_click=AsyncCachedVarState.force_refresh),
        ),
        rx.text("Note: The cached async var only updates when user_id changes, not when refresh_trigger changes."),
        spacing="4",
    )
```

In this example, `user_data` is a cached async computed var that simulates fetching user data.
It is only recomputed when `user_id` changes, not when other state variables like `refresh_trigger` change.
This demonstrates how caching works with async computed vars to optimize performance for expensive operations.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
import dataclasses
from typing import TypedDict

from pcweb.pages.docs import vars
```

# Custom Vars

As mentioned in the [vars page]({vars.base_vars.path}), Reflex vars must be JSON serializable.

This means we can support any Python primitive types, as well as lists, dicts, and tuples. However, you can also create more complex var types using dataclasses (recommended), TypedDict, or Pydantic models.

## Defining a Type

In this example, we will create a custom var type for storing translations using a dataclass.

Once defined, we can use it as a state var, and reference it from within a component.

```python demo exec
import googletrans
import dataclasses
from typing import TypedDict

@dataclasses.dataclass
class Translation:
    original_text: str
    translated_text: str

class TranslationState(rx.State):
    input_text: str = "Hola Mundo"
    current_translation: Translation = Translation(original_text="", translated_text="")

    # Explicitly define the setter method
    def set_input_text(self, value: str):
        self.input_text = value

    @rx.event
    def translate(self):
        self.current_translation.original_text = self.input_text
        self.current_translation.translated_text = googletrans.Translator().translate(self.input_text, dest="en").text

def translation_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.input(
            on_blur=TranslationState.set_input_text,
            default_value=TranslationState.input_text,
            placeholder="Text to translate...",
        ),
        rx.button("Translate", on_click=TranslationState.translate),
        rx.text(TranslationState.current_translation.translated_text),
    )
```

## Alternative Approaches

### Using TypedDict

You can also use TypedDict for defining custom var types:

```python
from typing import TypedDict

class Translation(TypedDict):
    original_text: str
    translated_text: str
```

### Using Pydantic Models

Pydantic models are another option for complex data structures:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Translation(BaseModel):
    original_text: str
    translated_text: str
```

For complex data structures, dataclasses are recommended as they provide a clean, type-safe way to define custom var types with good IDE support.


```python exec
import random
import time

import reflex as rx

from pcweb.pages.docs import vars
```

# Base Vars

Vars are any fields in your app that may change over time. A Var is directly
rendered into the frontend of the app.

Base vars are defined as fields in your State class.

They can have a preset default value. If you don't provide a default value, you
must provide a type annotation.

```md alert warning
# State Vars should provide type annotations.

Reflex relies on type annotations to determine the type of state vars during the compilation process.
```

```python demo exec
class TickerState(rx.State):
    ticker: str ="AAPL"
    price: str = "$150"


def ticker_example():
    return rx.center(
          rx.vstack(
                rx.heading(TickerState.ticker, size="3"),
                rx.text(f"Current Price: {TickerState.price}", font_size="md"),
                rx.text("Change: 4%", color="green"),
            ),

    )
```

In this example `ticker` and `price` are base vars in the app, which can be modified at runtime.

```md alert warning
# Vars must be JSON serializable.

Vars are used to communicate between the frontend and backend. They must be primitive Python types, Plotly figures, Pandas dataframes, or [a custom defined type]({vars.custom_vars.path}).
```

## Accessing state variables on different pages

State is just a python class and so can be defined on one page and then imported and used on another. Below we define `TickerState` class on the page `state.py` and then import it and use it on the page `index.py`.

```python
# state.py

class TickerState(rx.State):
    ticker: str = "AAPL"
    price: str = "$150"
```

```python
# index.py
from .state import TickerState

def ticker_example():
    return rx.center(
          rx.vstack(
                rx.heading(TickerState.ticker, size="3"),
                rx.text(f"Current Price: {TickerState.price}", font_size="md"),
                rx.text("Change: 4%", color="green"),
            ),

    )
```

## Backend-only Vars

Any Var in a state class that starts with an underscore (`_`) is considered backend
only and will **not be synchronized with the frontend**. Data associated with a
specific session that is _not directly rendered on the frontend should be stored
in a backend-only var_ to reduce network traffic and improve performance.

They have the advantage that they don't need to be JSON serializable, however
they must still be pickle-able to be used with redis in prod mode. They are
not directly renderable on the frontend, and **may be used to store sensitive
values that should not be sent to the client**.

```md alert warning
# Protect auth data and sensitive state in backend-only vars.

Regular vars and computed vars should **only** be used for rendering the state
of your app in the frontend. Having any type of permissions or authenticated state based on
a regular var presents a security risk as you may assume these have shared control
with the frontend (client) due to default setter methods.

For improved security, `state_auto_setters=False` may be set in `rxconfig.py`
to prevent the automatic generation of setters for regular vars, however, the
client will still be able to locally modify the contents of frontend vars as
they are presented in the UI.
```

For example, a backend-only var is used to store a large data structure which is
then paged to the frontend using cached vars.

```python demo exec
import numpy as np


class BackendVarState(rx.State):
    _backend: np.ndarray = np.array([random.randint(0, 100) for _ in range(100)])
    offset: int = 0
    limit: int = 10

    @rx.var(cache=True)
    def page(self) -> list[int]:
        return [
            int(x)  # explicit cast to int
            for x in self._backend[self.offset : self.offset + self.limit]
        ]

    @rx.var(cache=True)
    def page_number(self) -> int:
        return (self.offset // self.limit) + 1 + (1 if self.offset % self.limit else 0)

    @rx.var(cache=True)
    def total_pages(self) -> int:
        return len(self._backend) // self.limit + (1 if len(self._backend) % self.limit else 0)

    @rx.event
    def prev_page(self):
        self.offset = max(self.offset - self.limit, 0)

    @rx.event
    def next_page(self):
        if self.offset + self.limit < len(self._backend):
            self.offset += self.limit

    @rx.event
    def generate_more(self):
        self._backend = np.append(self._backend, [random.randint(0, 100) for _ in range(random.randint(0, 100))])

    @rx.event
    def set_limit(self, value: str):
        self.limit = int(value)

def backend_var_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.hstack(
            rx.button(
                "Prev",
                on_click=BackendVarState.prev_page,
            ),
            rx.text(f"Page {BackendVarState.page_number} / {BackendVarState.total_pages}"),
            rx.button(
                "Next",
                on_click=BackendVarState.next_page,
            ),
            rx.text("Page Size"),
            rx.input(
                width="5em",
                value=BackendVarState.limit,
                on_change=BackendVarState.set_limit,
            ),
            rx.button("Generate More", on_click=BackendVarState.generate_more),
        ),
        rx.list(
            rx.foreach(
                BackendVarState.page,
                lambda x, ix: rx.text(f"_backend[{ix + BackendVarState.offset}] = {x}"),
            ),
        ),
    )
```


## Using rx.field / rx.Field to improve type hinting for vars

When defining state variables you can use `rx.Field[T]` to annotate the variable's type. Then, you can initialize the variable using `rx.field(default_value)`, where `default_value` is an instance of type `T`. 

This approach makes the variable's type explicit, aiding static analysis tools in type checking. In addition, it shows you what methods are allowed to modify the variable in your frontend code, as they are listed in the type hint.

Below are two examples:

```python
import reflex as rx

app = rx.App()


class State(rx.State):
    x: rx.Field[bool] = rx.field(False)

    def flip(self):
        self.x = not self.x


@app.add_page
def index():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.button("Click me", on_click=State.flip),
        rx.text(State.x),
        rx.text(~State.x),
    )
```

Here `State.x`, as it is typed correctly as a `boolean` var, gets better code completion, i.e. here we get options such as `to_string()` or `equals()`.


```python
import reflex as rx

app = rx.App()


class State(rx.State):
    x: rx.Field[dict[str, list[int]]] = rx.field(default_factory=dict)


@app.add_page
def index():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text(State.x.values()[0][0]),
    )
```

Here `State.x`, as it is typed correctly as a `dict` of `str` to `list` of `int` var, gets better code completion, i.e. here we get options such as `contains()`, `keys()`, `values()`, `items()` or `merge()`.

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.templates.docpage import definition
```

# State

State allows us to create interactive apps that can respond to user input.
It defines the variables that can change over time, and the functions that can modify them.

```md video https://youtube.com/embed/ITOZkzjtjUA?start=1206&end=1869
# Video: State Overview
```

## State Basics

You can define state by creating a class that inherits from `rx.State`:

```python
import reflex as rx


class State(rx.State):
    """Define your app state here."""
```

A state class is made up of two parts: vars and event handlers.

**Vars** are variables in your app that can change over time.

**Event handlers** are functions that modify these vars in response to events.

These are the main concepts to understand how state works in Reflex:

```python eval
rx.grid(
    definition(
        "Base Var",
        rx.list.unordered(
            rx.list.item("Any variable in your app that can change over time."),
            rx.list.item(
                "Defined as a field in a ", rx.code("State"), " class"
            ),
            rx.list.item("Can only be modified by event handlers."),
        ),
    ),
    definition(
        "Computed Var",
        rx.list.unordered(
            rx.list.item("Vars that change automatically based on other vars."),
            rx.list.item(
                "Defined as functions using the ",
                rx.code("@rx.var"),
                " decorator.",
            ),
            rx.list.item(
                "Cannot be set by event handlers, are always recomputed when the state changes."
            ),
        ),
    ),
    definition(
        "Event Trigger",
        rx.list.unordered(
            rx.list.item(
                "A user interaction that triggers an event, such as a button click."
            ),
            rx.list.item(
                "Defined as special component props, such as ",
                rx.code("on_click"),
                ".",
            ),
            rx.list.item("Can be used to trigger event handlers."),
        ),
    ),
    definition(
        "Event Handlers",
        rx.list.unordered(
            rx.list.item(
                "Functions that update the state in response to events."
            ),
            rx.list.item(
                "Defined as methods in the ", rx.code("State"), " class."
            ),
            rx.list.item(
                "Can be called by event triggers, or by other event handlers."
            ),
        ),
    ),
    margin_bottom="1em",
    spacing="2",
    columns="2",
)
```

## Example

Here is a example of how to use state within a Reflex app.
Click the text to change its color.

```python demo exec
class ExampleState(rx.State):

    # A base var for the list of colors to cycle through.
    colors: list[str] = ["black", "red", "green", "blue", "purple"]

    # A base var for the index of the current color.
    index: int = 0

    @rx.event
    def next_color(self):
        """An event handler to go to the next color."""
        # Event handlers can modify the base vars.
        # Here we reference the base vars `colors` and `index`.
        self.index = (self.index + 1) % len(self.colors)

    @rx.var
    def color(self)-> str:
        """A computed var that returns the current color."""
        # Computed vars update automatically when the state changes.
        return self.colors[self.index]


def index():
    return rx.heading(
        "Welcome to Reflex!",
        # Event handlers can be bound to event triggers.
        on_click=ExampleState.next_color,
        # State vars can be bound to component props.
        color=ExampleState.color,
        _hover={"cursor": "pointer"},
    )
```

The base vars are `colors` and `index`. They are the only vars in the app that
may be directly modified within event handlers.

There is a single computed var, `color`, that is a function of the base vars. It
will be computed automatically whenever the base vars change.

The heading component links its `on_click` event to the
`ExampleState.next_color` event handler, which increments the color index.

```md alert success
# With Reflex, you never have to write an API.

All interactions between the frontend and backend are handled through events.
```

```md alert info
# State vs. Instance?

When building the UI of your app, reference vars and event handlers via the state class (`ExampleState`).

When writing backend event handlers, access and set vars via the instance (`self`).
```

```md alert warning
# Cannot print a State var.

The code `print(ExampleState.index)` will not work because the State var values are only known at compile time.
```

## Client States

Each user who opens your app has a unique ID and their own copy of the state.
This means that each user can interact with the app and modify the state
independently of other users.

Because Reflex internally creates a new instance of the state for each user, your code should
never directly initialize a state class.

```md alert info
# Try opening an app in multiple tabs to see how the state changes independently.
```

All user state is stored on the server, and all event handlers are executed on
the server. Reflex uses websockets to send events to the server, and to send
state updates back to the client.

## Helper Methods

Similar to backend vars, any method defined in a State class that begins with an
underscore `_` is considered a helper method. Such methods are not usable as
event triggers, but may be called from other event handler methods within the
state.

Functionality that should only be available on the backend, such as an
authenticated action, should use helper methods to ensure it is not accidentally
or maliciously triggered by the client.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import events, ui, vars
```

# Component State

_New in version 0.4.6_.

Defining a subclass of `rx.ComponentState` creates a special type of state that is tied to an
instance of a component, rather than existing globally in the app. A Component State combines
[UI code]({ui.overview.path}) with state [Vars]({vars.base_vars.path}) and
[Event Handlers]({events.events_overview.path}),
and is useful for creating reusable components which operate independently of each other.

```md alert warning
# ComponentState cannot be used inside `rx.foreach()` as it will only create one state instance for all elements in the loop. Each iteration of the foreach will share the same state, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
```

## Using ComponentState

```python demo exec
class ReusableCounter(rx.ComponentState):
    count: int = 0

    @rx.event
    def set_count(self, value: int):
        self.count = value

    @rx.event
    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1

    @rx.event
    def decrement(self):
        self.count -= 1

    @classmethod
    def get_component(cls, **props):
        return rx.hstack(
            rx.button("Decrement", on_click=cls.decrement),
            rx.text(cls.count),
            rx.button("Increment", on_click=cls.increment),
            **props,
        )

reusable_counter = ReusableCounter.create

def multiple_counters():
    return rx.vstack(
        reusable_counter(),
        reusable_counter(),
        reusable_counter(),
    )
```

The vars and event handlers defined on the `ReusableCounter`
class are treated similarly to a normal State class, but will be scoped to the component instance. Each time a
`reusable_counter` is created, a new state class for that instance of the component is also created.

The `get_component` classmethod is used to define the UI for the component and link it up to the State, which
is accessed via the `cls` argument. Other states may also be referenced by the returned component, but
`cls` will always be the instance of the `ComponentState` that is unique to the component being returned.

## Passing Props

Similar to a normal Component, the `ComponentState.create` classmethod accepts the arbitrary
`*children` and `**props` arguments, and by default passes them to your `get_component` classmethod.
These arguments may be used to customize the component, either by applying defaults or
passing props to certain subcomponents.

```python eval
rx.divider()
```

In the following example, we implement an editable text component that allows the user to click on
the text to turn it into an input field. If the user does not provide their own `value` or `on_change`
props, then the defaults defined in the `EditableText` class will be used.

```python demo exec
class EditableText(rx.ComponentState):
    text: str = "Click to edit"
    original_text: str
    editing: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def set_text(self, value: str):
        self.text = value

    @rx.event
    def start_editing(self, original_text: str):
        self.original_text = original_text
        self.editing = True

    @rx.event
    def stop_editing(self):
        self.editing = False
        self.original_text = ""

    @classmethod
    def get_component(cls, **props):
        # Pop component-specific props with defaults before passing **props
        value = props.pop("value", cls.text)
        on_change = props.pop("on_change", cls.set_text)
        cursor = props.pop("cursor", "pointer")

        # Set the initial value of the State var.
        initial_value = props.pop("initial_value", None)
        if initial_value is not None:
            # Update the pydantic model to use the initial value as default.
            cls.__fields__["text"].default = initial_value

        # Form elements for editing, saving and reverting the text.
        edit_controls = rx.hstack(
            rx.input(
                value=value,
                on_change=on_change,
                **props,
            ),
            rx.icon_button(
                rx.icon("x"),
                on_click=[
                    on_change(cls.original_text),
                    cls.stop_editing,
                ],
                type="button",
                color_scheme="red",
            ),
            rx.icon_button(rx.icon("check")),
            align="center",
            width="100%",
        )

        # Return the text or the form based on the editing Var.
        return rx.cond(
            cls.editing,
            rx.form(
                edit_controls,
                on_submit=lambda _: cls.stop_editing(),
            ),
            rx.text(
                value,
                on_click=cls.start_editing(value),
                cursor=cursor,
                **props,
            ),
        )


editable_text = EditableText.create


def editable_text_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        editable_text(),
        editable_text(initial_value="Edit me!", color="blue"),
        editable_text(initial_value="Reflex is fun", font_family="monospace", width="100%"),
    )
```

```python eval
rx.divider()
```

Because this `EditableText` component is designed to be reusable, it can handle the case
where the `value` and `on_change` are linked to a normal global state.

```python exec
# Hack because flexdown re-inits modules
EditableText._per_component_state_instance_count = 4
```

```python demo exec
class EditableTextDemoState(rx.State):
    value: str = "Global state text"

    @rx.event
    def set_value(self, value: str):
        self.value = value

def editable_text_with_global_state():
    return rx.vstack(
        editable_text(value=EditableTextDemoState.value, on_change=EditableTextDemoState.set_value),
        rx.text(EditableTextDemoState.value.upper()),
    )
```

## Accessing the State

The underlying state class of a `ComponentState` is accessible via the `.State` attribute. To use it,
assign an instance of the component to a local variable, then include that instance in the page.

```python exec
# Hack because flexdown re-inits modules
ReusableCounter._per_component_state_instance_count = 4
```

```python demo exec
def counter_sum():
    counter1 = reusable_counter()
    counter2 = reusable_counter()
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text(f"Total: {counter1.State.count + counter2.State.count}"),
        counter1,
        counter2,
    )
```

```python eval
rx.divider()
```

Other components can also affect a `ComponentState` by referencing its event handlers or vars
via the `.State` attribute.

```python exec
# Hack because flexdown re-inits modules
ReusableCounter._per_component_state_instance_count = 6
```

```python demo exec
def extended_counter():
    counter1 = reusable_counter()
    return rx.vstack(
        counter1,
        rx.hstack(
            rx.icon_button(rx.icon("step_back"), on_click=counter1.State.set_count(0)),
            rx.icon_button(rx.icon("plus"), on_click=counter1.State.increment),
            rx.button("Double", on_click=counter1.State.set_count(counter1.State.count * 2)),
            rx.button("Triple", on_click=counter1.State.set_count(counter1.State.count * 3)),
        ),
    )
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.templates.docpage import definition
```

# Shared State

_New in version 0.8.23_.

Defining a subclass of `rx.SharedState` creates a special type of state that may be shared by multiple clients. Shared State is useful for creating real-time collaborative applications where multiple users need to see and interact with the same data simultaneously.

## Using SharedState

An `rx.SharedState` subclass behaves similarly to a normal `rx.State` subclass and will be private to each client until it is explicitly linked to a given token. Once linked, any changes made to the Shared State by one client will be propagated to all other clients sharing the same token.

```md alert info
# What should be used as a token?

A token can be any string that uniquely identifies a group of clients that should share the same state. Common choices include room IDs, document IDs, or user group IDs. Ensure that the token is securely generated and managed to prevent unauthorized access to shared state.
```

```md alert warning
# Linked token cannot contain underscore (_) characters.

Underscore characters are currently used as an internal delimiter for tokens and will raise an exception if used for linked states.

This is a temporary restriction and will be removed in a future release.
```

### Linking Shared State

An `rx.SharedState` subclass can be linked to a token using the `_link_to` method, which is async and returns the linked state instance. After linking, subsequent events triggered against the shared state will be executed in the context of the linked state. To unlink from the token, return the result of awaiting the `_unlink` method.

To try out the collaborative counter example, open this page in a second or third browser tab and click the "Link" button. You should see the count increment in all tabs when you click the "Increment" button in any of them.

```python demo exec
class CollaborativeCounter(rx.SharedState):
    count: int = 0

    @rx.event
    async def toggle_link(self):
        if self._linked_to:
            return await self._unlink()
        else:
            linked_state = await self._link_to("shared-global-counter")
            linked_state.count += 1  # Increment count on link

    @rx.var
    def is_linked(self) -> bool:
        return bool(self._linked_to)

def shared_state_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text(f"Collaborative Count: {CollaborativeCounter.count}"),
        rx.cond(
            CollaborativeCounter.is_linked,
            rx.button("Unlink", on_click=CollaborativeCounter.toggle_link),
            rx.button("Link", on_click=CollaborativeCounter.toggle_link),
        ),
        rx.button("Increment", on_click=CollaborativeCounter.set_count(CollaborativeCounter.count + 1)),
    )

# Computed vars may reference SharedState

Computed vars in other states may reference shared state data using `get_state`, just like private states. This allows private states to provide personalized views of shared data.

Whenever the shared state is updated, any computed vars depending on it will be re-evaluated in the context of each client's private state.
```

### Identifying Clients

Each client linked to a shared state can be uniquely identified by their `self.router.session.client_token`. Shared state events should _never_ rely on identifiers passed in as parameters, as these can be spoofed from the client. Instead, always use the `client_token` to identify the client triggering the event.

```python demo exec
import uuid

class SharedRoom(rx.SharedState):
    shared_room: str = rx.LocalStorage()
    _users: dict[str, str] = {}

    @rx.var
    def user_list(self) -> str:
        return ", ".join(self._users.values())

    @rx.event
    async def join(self, username: str):
        if not self.shared_room:
            self.shared_room = f"shared-room-{uuid.uuid4()}"
        linked_state = await self._link_to(self.shared_room)
        linked_state._users[self.router.session.client_token] = username

    @rx.event
    async def leave(self):
        if self._linked_to:
            return await self._unlink()


class PrivateState(rx.State):
    @rx.event
    def handle_submit(self, form_data: dict):
        return SharedRoom.join(form_data["username"])

    @rx.var
    async def user_in_room(self) -> bool:
        shared_state = await self.get_state(SharedRoom)
        return self.router.session.client_token in shared_state._users


def shared_room_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text("Shared Room"),
        rx.text(f"Users: {SharedRoom.user_list}"),
        rx.cond(
            PrivateState.user_in_room,
            rx.button("Leave Room", on_click=SharedRoom.leave),
            rx.form(
                rx.input(placeholder="Enter your name", name="username"),
                rx.button("Join Room"),
                on_submit=PrivateState.handle_submit,
            ),
        ),
    )
```

```md alert warning
# Store sensitive data in backend-only vars with an underscore prefix

Shared State data is synchronized to all linked clients, so avoid storing sensitive information (e.g., client_tokens, user credentials, personal data) in frontend vars, which would expose them to all users and allow them to be modified outside of explicit event handlers. Instead, use backend-only vars (prefixed with an underscore) to keep sensitive data secure on the server side and provide controlled access through event handlers and computed vars.
```

### Introspecting Linked Clients

An `rx.SharedState` subclass has two attributes for determining link status and peers, which are updated during linking and unlinking, and come with some caveats.

**`_linked_to: str`**

Provides the token that the state is currently linked to, or empty string if not linked.

This attribute is only set on the linked state instance returned by `_link_to`. It will be an empty string on any unlinked shared state instances. However, if another state links to a client's private token, then the `_linked_to` attribute will be set to the client's token rather than an empty string.

When `_linked_to` equals `self.router.session.client_token`, it is assumed that the current client is unlinked, but another client has linked to this client's private state. Although this is possible, it is generally discouraged to link shared states to private client tokens.

**`_linked_from: set[str]`**

A set of client tokens that are currently linked to this shared state instance.

This attribute is only updated during `_link_to` and `_unlink` calls. In situations where unlinking occurs otherwise, such as client disconnects, `self.reset()` is called, or state expires on the backend, `_linked_from` may contain stale client tokens that are no longer linked. These can be cleaned periodically by checking if the tokens still exist in `app.event_namespace.token_to_sid`.

## Guidelines and Best Practices

### Keep Shared State Minimal

When defining a shared state, aim to keep it as minimal as possible. Only include the data and methods that need to be shared between clients. This helps reduce complexity and potential synchronization issues.

Linked states are always loaded into the tree for each event on each linked client and large states take longer to serialize and transmit over the network. Because linked states are regularly loaded in the context of many clients, they incur higher lock contention, so minimizing loading time also reduces lock waiting time for other clients.

### Prefer Backend-Only Vars in Shared State

A shared state should primarily use backend-only vars (prefixed with an underscore) to store shared data. Often, not all users of the shared state need visibility into all of the data in the shared state. Use computed vars to provide sanitized access to shared data as needed.

```python
from typing import Literal

class SharedGameState(rx.SharedState):
    # Sensitive user metadata stored in backend-only variable.
    _players: dict[str, Literal["X", "O"]] = {}

    @rx.event
    def make_move(self, x: int, y: int):
        # Identify users by client_token, never by arguments passed to the event.
        player_token = self.router.session.client_token
        player_piece = self._players.get(player_token)
```

```md alert warning
# Do Not Trust Event Handler Arguments

The client can send whatever data it wants to event handlers, so never rely on arguments passed to event handlers for sensitive information such as user identity or permissions. Always use secure identifiers like `self.router.session.client_token` to identify the client triggering the event.
```

### Expose Per-User Data via Private States

If certain data in the shared state needs to be personalized for each user, prefer to expose that data through computed vars defined in private states. This allows each user to have their own view of the shared data without exposing sensitive information to other users. It also reduces the amount of unrelated data sent to each client and improves caching performance by keeping each user's view cached in their own private state, rather than always recomputing the shared state vars for each user that needs to have their information updated.

Use async computed vars with `get_state` to access shared state data from private states.

```python
class UserGameState(rx.State):
    @rx.var
    async def player_piece(self) -> str | None:
        shared_state = await self.get_state(SharedGameState)
        return shared_state._players.get(self.router.session.client_token)
```

### Use Dynamic Routes for Linked Tokens

It is often convenient to define dynamic routes that include the linked token as part of the URL path. This allows users to easily share links to specific shared state instances. The dynamic route can use `on_load` to link the shared state to the token extracted from the URL.

```python
class SharedRoom(rx.SharedState):
    async def on_load(self):
        # `self.room_id` is the automatically defined dynamic route var.
        await self._link_to(self.room_id.replace("_", "-") or "default-room")


def room_page(): ...


app.add_route(
    room_page,
    path="/room/[room_id]",
    on_load=SharedRoom.on_load,
)
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from typing import Any
```

# Substates

Substates allow you to break up your state into multiple classes to make it more manageable. This is useful as your app
grows, as it allows you to think about each page as a separate entity. Substates also allow you to share common state
resources, such as variables or event handlers.

When a particular state class becomes too large, breaking it up into several substates can bring performance
benefits by only loading parts of the state that are used to handle a certain event.

## Multiple States

One common pattern is to create a substate for each page in your app.
This allows you to think about each page as a separate entity, and makes it easier to manage your code as your app grows.

To create a substate, simply inherit from `rx.State` multiple times:

```python
# index.py
import reflex as rx

class IndexState(rx.State):
    """Define your main state here."""
    data: str = "Hello World"


@rx.page()
def index():
    return rx.box(rx.text(IndexState.data))

# signup.py
import reflex as rx


class SignupState(rx.State):
    """Define your signup state here."""
    username: str = ""
    password: str = ""

    def signup(self):
        ...


@rx.page()
def signup_page():
    return rx.box(
        rx.input(value=SignupState.username),
        rx.input(value=SignupState.password),
    )

# login.py
import reflex as rx

class LoginState(rx.State):
    """Define your login state here."""
    username: str = ""
    password: str = ""

    def login(self):
        ...

@rx.page()
def login_page():
    return rx.box(
        rx.input(value=LoginState.username),
        rx.input(value=LoginState.password),
    )
```

Separating the states is purely a matter of organization. You can still access the state from other pages by importing the state class.

```python
# index.py

import reflex as rx

from signup import SignupState

...

def index():
    return rx.box(
        rx.text(IndexState.data),
        rx.input(value=SignupState.username),
        rx.input(value=SignupState.password),
    )
```

## Accessing Arbitrary States

An event handler in a particular state can access and modify vars in another state instance by calling
the `get_state` async method and passing the desired state class. If the requested state is not already loaded,
it will be loaded and deserialized on demand.

In the following example, the `GreeterState` accesses the `SettingsState` to get the `salutation` and uses it
to update the `message` var.

Notably, the widget that sets the salutation does NOT have to load the `GreeterState` when handling the
input `on_change` event, which improves performance.

```python demo exec
class SettingsState(rx.State):
     salutation: str = "Hello"

     def set_salutation(self, value: str):
        self.salutation = value

def set_salutation_popover():
    return rx.popover.root(
        rx.popover.trigger(
            rx.icon_button(rx.icon("settings")),
        ),
        rx.popover.content(
            rx.input(
                value=SettingsState.salutation,
                on_change=SettingsState.set_salutation
            ),
        ),
    )


class GreeterState(rx.State):
    message: str = ""

    @rx.event
    async def handle_submit(self, form_data: dict[str, Any]):
        settings = await self.get_state(SettingsState)
        self.message = f"{settings.salutation} {form_data['name']}"


def index():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.form(
            rx.vstack(
                rx.hstack(
                    rx.input(placeholder="Name", id="name"),
                    set_salutation_popover(),
                ),
                rx.button("Submit"),
            ),
            reset_on_submit=True,
            on_submit=GreeterState.handle_submit,
        ),
        rx.text(GreeterState.message),
    )
```

### Accessing Individual Var Values

In addition to accessing entire state instances with `get_state`, you can retrieve individual variable values using the `get_var_value` method:

```python
# Access a var value from another state
value = await self.get_var_value(OtherState.some_var)
```

This async method is particularly useful when you only need a specific value rather than loading the entire state. Using `get_var_value` can be more efficient than `get_state` when:

1. You only need to access a single variable from another state
2. The other state contains a large amount of data
3. You want to avoid loading unnecessary data into memory

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use `get_var_value` to access data between states:

```python demo exec
# Define a state that holds a counter value
class CounterState(rx.State):
    # This variable will be accessed from another state
    count: int = 0

    @rx.event
    async def increment(self):
        # Increment the counter when the button is clicked
        self.count += 1

# Define a separate state that will display information
class DisplayState(rx.State):
    # This will show the current count value
    message: str = ""

    @rx.event
    async def show_count(self):
        # Use get_var_value to access just the count variable from CounterState
        # This is more efficient than loading the entire state with get_state
        current = await self.get_var_value(CounterState.count)
        self.message = f"Current count: {current}"

def var_value_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading("Get Var Value Example"),
        rx.hstack(
            # This button calls DisplayState.show_count to display the current count
            rx.button("Get Count Value", on_click=DisplayState.show_count),
            # This button calls CounterState.increment to increase the counter
            rx.button("Increment", on_click=CounterState.increment),
        ),
        # Display the message from DisplayState
        rx.text(DisplayState.message),
        width="100%",
        align="center",
        spacing="4",
    )
```

In this example:
1. We have two separate states: `CounterState` which manages a counter, and `DisplayState` which displays information
2. When you click "Increment", it calls `CounterState.increment()` to increase the counter value
3. When you click "Show Count", it calls `DisplayState.show_count()` which uses `get_var_value` to retrieve just the count value from `CounterState` without loading the entire state
4. The current count is then displayed in the message

This pattern is useful when you have multiple states that need to interact with each other but don't need to access all of each other's data.

If the var is not retrievable, `get_var_value` will raise an `UnretrievableVarValueError`.

## Performance Implications

When an event handler is called, Reflex will load the data not only for the substate containing
the event handler, but also all of its substates and parent states as well.
If a state has a large number of substates or contains a large amount of data, it can slow down processing
of events associated with that state.

For optimal performance, keep a flat structure with most substate classes directly inheriting from `rx.State`.
Only inherit from another state when the parent holds data that is commonly used by the substate.
Implementing different parts of the app with separate, unconnected states ensures that only the necessary
data is loaded for processing events for a particular page or component.

Avoid defining computed vars inside a state that contains a large amount of data, as
states with computed vars are always loaded to ensure the values are recalculated.
When using computed vars, it better to define them in a state that directly inherits from `rx.State` and
does not have other states inheriting from it, to avoid loading unnecessary data.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.templates.docpage import definition
```

# State Mixins

State mixins allow you to define shared functionality that can be reused across multiple State classes. This is useful for creating reusable components, shared business logic, or common state patterns.

## What are State Mixins?

A state mixin is a State class marked with `mixin=True` that cannot be instantiated directly but can be inherited by other State classes. Mixins provide a way to share:

- Base variables
- Computed variables
- Event handlers
- Backend variables

## Basic Mixin Definition

To create a state mixin, inherit from `rx.State` and pass `mixin=True`:

```python demo exec
class CounterMixin(rx.State, mixin=True):
    count: int = 0

    @rx.var
    def count_display(self) -> str:
        return f"Count: {self.count}"

    @rx.event
    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1

class MyState(CounterMixin, rx.State):
    name: str = "App"

def counter_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(MyState.name),
        rx.text(MyState.count_display),
        rx.button("Increment", on_click=MyState.increment),
        spacing="4",
        align="center",
    )
```

In this example, `MyState` automatically inherits the `count` variable, `count_display` computed variable, and `increment` event handler from `CounterMixin`.

## Multiple Mixin Inheritance

You can inherit from multiple mixins to combine different pieces of functionality:

```python demo exec
class TimestampMixin(rx.State, mixin=True):
    last_updated: str = ""

    @rx.event
    def update_timestamp(self):
        import datetime
        self.last_updated = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")

class LoggingMixin(rx.State, mixin=True):
    log_messages: list[str] = []

    @rx.event
    def log_message(self, message: str):
        self.log_messages.append(message)

class CombinedState(CounterMixin, TimestampMixin, LoggingMixin, rx.State):
    app_name: str = "Multi-Mixin App"

    @rx.event
    def increment_with_log(self):
        self.increment()
        self.update_timestamp()
        self.log_message(f"Count incremented to {self.count}")

def multi_mixin_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(CombinedState.app_name),
        rx.text(CombinedState.count_display),
        rx.text(f"Last updated: {CombinedState.last_updated}"),
        rx.button("Increment & Log", on_click=CombinedState.increment_with_log),
        rx.cond(
            CombinedState.log_messages.length() > 0,
            rx.vstack(
                rx.foreach(
                    CombinedState.log_messages[-3:],
                    rx.text
                ),
                spacing="1"
            ),
            rx.text("No logs yet")
        ),
        spacing="4",
        align="center",
    )
```

## Backend Variables in Mixins

Mixins can also include backend variables (prefixed with `_`) that are not sent to the client:

```python demo exec
class DatabaseMixin(rx.State, mixin=True):
    _db_connection: dict = {}  # Backend only
    user_count: int = 0        # Sent to client

    @rx.event
    def fetch_user_count(self):
        # Simulate database query
        self.user_count = len(self._db_connection.get("users", []))

class AppState(DatabaseMixin, rx.State):
    app_title: str = "User Management"

def database_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(AppState.app_title),
        rx.text(f"User count: {AppState.user_count}"),
        rx.button("Fetch Users", on_click=AppState.fetch_user_count),
        spacing="4",
        align="center",
    )
```

Backend variables are useful for storing sensitive data, database connections, or other server-side state that shouldn't be exposed to the client.

## Computed Variables in Mixins

Computed variables in mixins work the same as in regular State classes:

```python demo exec
class FormattingMixin(rx.State, mixin=True):
    value: float = 0.0

    @rx.var
    def formatted_value(self) -> str:
        return f"${self.value:.2f}"

    @rx.var
    def is_positive(self) -> bool:
        return self.value > 0

class PriceState(FormattingMixin, rx.State):
    product_name: str = "Widget"

    @rx.event
    def set_price(self, price: str):
        try:
            self.value = float(price)
        except ValueError:
            self.value = 0.0

def formatting_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(f"Product: {PriceState.product_name}"),
        rx.text(f"Price: {PriceState.formatted_value}"),
        rx.text(f"Positive: {PriceState.is_positive}"),
        rx.input(
            placeholder="Enter price",
            on_blur=PriceState.set_price,
        ),
        spacing="4",
        align="center",
    )
```

## Nested Mixin Inheritance

Mixins can inherit from other mixins to create hierarchical functionality:

```python demo exec
class BaseMixin(rx.State, mixin=True):
    base_value: str = "base"

class ExtendedMixin(BaseMixin, mixin=True):
    extended_value: str = "extended"

    @rx.var
    def combined_value(self) -> str:
        return f"{self.base_value}-{self.extended_value}"

class FinalState(ExtendedMixin, rx.State):
    final_value: str = "final"

def nested_mixin_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text(f"Base: {FinalState.base_value}"),
        rx.text(f"Extended: {FinalState.extended_value}"),
        rx.text(f"Combined: {FinalState.combined_value}"),
        rx.text(f"Final: {FinalState.final_value}"),
        spacing="4",
        align="center",
    )
```

This pattern allows you to build complex functionality by composing simpler mixins.

## Best Practices

```md alert info
# Mixin Design Guidelines

- **Single Responsibility**: Each mixin should have a focused purpose
- **Avoid Deep Inheritance**: Keep mixin hierarchies shallow for clarity
- **Document Dependencies**: If mixins depend on specific variables, document them
- **Test Mixins**: Create test cases for mixin functionality
- **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names ending with "Mixin"
```

## Limitations

```md alert warning
# Important Limitations

- Mixins cannot be instantiated directly - they must be inherited by concrete State classes
- Variable name conflicts between mixins are resolved by method resolution order (MRO)
- Mixins cannot override methods from the base State class
- The `mixin=True` parameter is required when defining a mixin
```

## Common Use Cases

State mixins are particularly useful for:

- **Form Validation**: Shared validation logic across forms
- **UI State Management**: Common modal, loading, or notification patterns
- **Logging**: Centralized logging and debugging
- **API Integration**: Shared HTTP client functionality
- **Data Formatting**: Consistent data presentation across components

```python demo exec
class ValidationMixin(rx.State, mixin=True):
    errors: dict[str, str] = {}
    is_loading: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def validate_email(self, email: str) -> bool:
        if "@" not in email or "." not in email:
            self.errors["email"] = "Invalid email format"
            return False
        self.errors.pop("email", None)
        return True

    @rx.event
    def validate_required(self, field: str, value: str) -> bool:
        if not value.strip():
            self.errors[field] = f"{field.title()} is required"
            return False
        self.errors.pop(field, None)
        return True

    @rx.event
    def clear_errors(self):
        self.errors = {}

class ContactFormState(ValidationMixin, rx.State):
    name: str = ""
    email: str = ""
    message: str = ""

    def set_name(self, value: str):
        self.name = value

    def set_email(self, value: str):
        self.email = value

    def set_message(self, value: str):
        self.message = value

    @rx.event
    def submit_form(self):
        self.clear_errors()
        valid_name = self.validate_required("name", self.name)
        valid_email = self.validate_email(self.email)
        valid_message = self.validate_required("message", self.message)

        if valid_name and valid_email and valid_message:
            self.is_loading = True
            yield rx.sleep(1)
            self.is_loading = False
            self.name = ""
            self.email = ""
            self.message = ""

def validation_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading("Contact Form"),
        rx.input(
            placeholder="Name",
            value=ContactFormState.name,
            on_change=ContactFormState.set_name,
        ),
        rx.cond(
            ContactFormState.errors.contains("name"),
            rx.text(ContactFormState.errors["name"], color="red"),
        ),
        rx.input(
            placeholder="Email",
            value=ContactFormState.email,
            on_change=ContactFormState.set_email,
        ),
        rx.cond(
            ContactFormState.errors.contains("email"),
            rx.text(ContactFormState.errors["email"], color="red"),
        ),
        rx.text_area(
            placeholder="Message",
            value=ContactFormState.message,
            on_change=ContactFormState.set_message,
        ),
        rx.cond(
            ContactFormState.errors.contains("message"),
            rx.text(ContactFormState.errors["message"], color="red"),
        ),
        rx.button(
            "Submit",
            on_click=ContactFormState.submit_form,
            loading=ContactFormState.is_loading,
        ),
        spacing="4",
        align="center",
        width="300px",
    )
```

By using state mixins, you can create modular, reusable state logic that keeps your application organized and reduces code duplication.

components:
  - rx.clipboard

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import styling
```

# Clipboard

_New in 0.5.6_

The Clipboard component can be used to respond to paste events with complex data.

If the Clipboard component is included in a page without children,
`rx.clipboard()`, then it will attach to the document's `paste` event handler
and will be triggered when data is pasted anywhere into the page.

```python demo exec
class ClipboardPasteState(rx.State):
    @rx.event
    def on_paste(self, data: list[tuple[str, str]]):
        for mime_type, item in data:
            yield rx.toast(f"Pasted {mime_type} data: {item}")


def clipboard_example():
    return rx.fragment(
        rx.clipboard(on_paste=ClipboardPasteState.on_paste),
        "Paste Content Here",
    )
```

The `data` argument passed to the `on_paste` method is a list of tuples, where
each tuple contains the MIME type of the pasted data and the data itself. Binary
data will be base64 encoded as a data URI, and can be decoded using python's
`urlopen` or used directly as the `src` prop of an image.

## Scoped Paste Events

If you want to limit the scope of the paste event to a specific element, wrap
the `rx.clipboard` component around the elements that should trigger the paste
event.

To avoid having outer paste handlers also trigger the event, you can use the
event action `.stop_propagation` to prevent the paste from bubbling up through
the DOM.

If you need to also prevent the default action of pasting the data into a text
box, you can also attach the `.prevent_default` action.

```python demo exec
class ClipboardPasteImageState(rx.State):
    last_image_uri: str = ""

    def on_paste(self, data: list[tuple[str, str]]):
        for mime_type, item in data:
            if mime_type.startswith("image/"):
                self.last_image_uri = item
                break
        else:
            return rx.toast("Did not find an image in the pasted data")


def clipboard_image_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.clipboard(
            rx.input(placeholder="Paste Image (stop propagation)"),
            on_paste=ClipboardPasteImageState.on_paste.stop_propagation
        ),
        rx.clipboard(
            rx.input(placeholder="Paste Image (prevent default)"),
            on_paste=ClipboardPasteImageState.on_paste.prevent_default
        ),
        rx.image(src=ClipboardPasteImageState.last_image_uri),
    )
```

 components:
     - rx.theme
     - rx.theme_panel
---

# Theme

 The `Theme` component is used to change the theme of the application. The `Theme` can be set directly in the rx.App.

 ```python
 app = rx.App(
     theme=rx.theme(
         appearance="light", has_background=True, radius="large", accent_color="teal"
     )
 )
 ```

 # Theme Panel

 The `ThemePanel` component is a container for the `Theme` component. It provides a way to change the theme of the application.

 ```python
 rx.theme_panel()
 ```

 The theme panel is closed by default. You can set it open `default_open=True`.

 ```python
 rx.theme_panel(default_open=True)
 ```

description: Skeleton, a loading placeholder component for content that is not yet available.
components:
    - rx.skeleton
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Skeleton (loading placeholder)

`Skeleton` is a loading placeholder component that serves as a visual placeholder while content is loading.
It is useful for maintaining the layout's structure and providing users with a sense of progression while awaiting the final content.

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.skeleton(rx.button("button-small"), height="10px"),
    rx.skeleton(rx.button("button-big"), height="20px"),
    rx.skeleton(rx.text("Text is loaded."), loading=True,),
    rx.skeleton(rx.text("Text is already loaded."), loading=False,),
),
```

When using `Skeleton` with text, wrap the text itself instead of the parent element to have a placeholder of the same size.

Use the loading prop to control whether the skeleton or its children are displayed. Skeleton preserves the dimensions of children when they are hidden and disables interactive elements.

# HTML

Reflex also provides a set of HTML elements that can be used to create web pages. These elements are the same as the HTML elements that are used in web development. These elements come unstyled bhy default. You can style them using style props or tailwindcss classes.

The following is a list of the HTML elements that are available in Reflex:

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import styling
```

# Memo

The `memo` decorator is used to optimize component rendering by memoizing components that don't need to be re-rendered. This is particularly useful for expensive components that depend on specific props and don't need to be re-rendered when other state changes in your application.

## Requirements

When using `rx.memo`, you must follow these requirements:

1. **Type all arguments**: All arguments to a memoized component must have type annotations.
2. **Use keyword arguments**: When calling a memoized component, you must use keyword arguments (not positional arguments).

## Basic Usage

When you wrap a component function with `@rx.memo`, the component will only re-render when its props change. This helps improve performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

```python
# Define a state class to track count
class DemoState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0
    
    @rx.event
    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1

# Define a memoized component
@rx.memo
def expensive_component(label: str) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(label),
        rx.text("This component only re-renders when props change!"),
        rx.divider(),
    )

# Use the memoized component in your app
def index():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading("Memo Example"),
        rx.text("Count: 0"),  # This will update with state.count
        rx.button("Increment", on_click=DemoState.increment),
        rx.divider(),
        expensive_component(label="Memoized Component"),  # Must use keyword arguments
        spacing="4",
        padding="4",
        border_radius="md",
        border="1px solid #eaeaea",
    )
```

In this example, the `expensive_component` will only re-render when the `label` prop changes, not when the `count` state changes.

## With Event Handlers

You can also use `rx.memo` with components that have event handlers:

```python
# Define a state class to track clicks
class ButtonState(rx.State):
    clicks: int = 0
    
    @rx.event
    def increment(self):
        self.clicks += 1

# Define a memoized button component
@rx.memo
def my_button(text: str, on_click: rx.EventHandler) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.button(text, on_click=on_click)

# Use the memoized button in your app
def index():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text("Clicks: 0"),  # This will update with state.clicks
        my_button(
            text="Click me", 
            on_click=ButtonState.increment
        ),
        spacing="4",
    )
```

## With State Variables

When used with state variables, memoized components will only re-render when the specific state variables they depend on change:

```python
# Define a state class with multiple variables
class AppState(rx.State):
    name: str = "World"
    count: int = 0
    
    @rx.event
    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1
        
    @rx.event
    def set_name(self, name: str):
        self.name = name

# Define a memoized greeting component
@rx.memo
def greeting(name: str) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.heading("Hello, " + name)  # Will display the name prop

# Use the memoized component with state variables
def index():
    return rx.vstack(
        greeting(name=AppState.name),  # Must use keyword arguments
        rx.text("Count: 0"),  # Will display the count
        rx.button("Increment Count", on_click=AppState.increment),
        rx.input(
            placeholder="Enter your name", 
            on_change=AppState.set_name,
            value="World",  # Will be bound to AppState.name
        ),
        spacing="4",
    )
```

## Advanced Event Handler Example

You can also pass arguments to event handlers in memoized components:

```python
# Define a state class to track messages
class MessageState(rx.State):
    message: str = ""
    
    @rx.event
    def set_message(self, text: str):
        self.message = text

# Define a memoized component with event handlers that pass arguments
@rx.memo
def action_buttons(on_action: rx.EventHandler[rx.event.passthrough_event_spec(str)]) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.button("Save", on_click=on_action("Saved!")),
        rx.button("Delete", on_click=on_action("Deleted!")),
        rx.button("Cancel", on_click=on_action("Cancelled!")),
        spacing="2",
    )

# Use the memoized component with event handlers
def index():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text("Status: "),  # Will display the message
        action_buttons(on_action=MessageState.set_message),
        spacing="4",
    )
```

## Performance Considerations

Use `rx.memo` for:
- Components with expensive rendering logic
- Components that render the same result given the same props
- Components that re-render too often due to parent component updates

Avoid using `rx.memo` for:
- Simple components where the memoization overhead might exceed the performance gain
- Components that almost always receive different props on re-render

components:
    - rx.script
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Script

The Script component can be used to include inline javascript or javascript files by URL.

It uses the [`next/script` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/script) to inject the script and can be safely used with conditional rendering to allow script side effects to be controlled by the state.

```python
rx.script("console.log('inline javascript')")
```

Complex inline scripting should be avoided.
If the code to be included is more than a couple lines, it is more maintainable to implement it in a separate javascript file in the `assets` directory and include it via the `src` prop.

```python
rx.script(src="/my-custom.js")
```

This component is particularly helpful for including tracking and social scripts.
Any additional attrs needed for the script tag can be supplied via `custom_attrs` prop.

```python
rx.script(src="//gc.zgo.at/count.js", custom_attrs=\{"data-goatcounter": "https://reflextoys.goatcounter.com/count"})
```

This code renders to something like the following to enable stat counting with a third party service.

```jsx
<script src="//gc.zgo.at/count.js" data-goatcounter="https://reflextoys.goatcounter.com/count" data-nscript="afterInteractive"></script>
```

components:
    - rx.html
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import styling
```

# HTML Embed

The HTML component can be used to render raw HTML code.

Before you reach for this component, consider using Reflex's raw HTML element support instead.

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.html("<h1>Hello World</h1>"),
    rx.html("<h2>Hello World</h2>"),
    rx.html("<h3>Hello World</h3>"),
    rx.html("<h4>Hello World</h4>"),
    rx.html("<h5>Hello World</h5>"),
    rx.html("<h6>Hello World</h6>"),
)
```

```md alert
# Missing Styles?
Reflex uses Radix-UI and tailwind for styling, both of which reset default styles for headings. 
If you are using the html component and want pretty default styles, consider setting `class_name='prose'`, adding `@tailwindcss/typography` package to `frontend_packages` and enabling it via `tailwind` config in `rxconfig.py`. See the [Tailwind docs]({styling.overview.path}) for an example of adding this plugin.
```

In this example, we render an image.

```python demo
rx.html("<img src='https://reflex.dev/reflex_banner.png' />")
```

components:
    - rx.blockquote
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Blockquote

```python demo
rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.")
```

## Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the blockquote. The prop also provides correct line height and corrective letter spacing—as text size increases, the relative line height and letter spacing decrease.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="1"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="2"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="3"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="4"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="5"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="6"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="7"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="8"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="9"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

## Weight

Use the `weight` prop to set the blockquote weight.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", weight="light"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", weight="regular"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", weight="medium"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", weight="bold"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

## Color

Use the `color_scheme` prop to assign a specific color, ignoring the global theme.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", color_scheme="indigo"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", color_scheme="cyan"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", color_scheme="crimson"),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", color_scheme="orange"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

## High Contrast

Use the `high_contrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts."),
    rx.blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", high_contrast=True),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```


---
components:
    - rx.text
    - rx.text.em

---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Text

```python demo
rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")
```

## As another element

Use the `as_` prop to render text as a `p`, `label`, `div` or `span`. This prop is purely semantic and does not alter visual appearance.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.text("This is a ", rx.text.strong("paragraph"), " element.", as_="p"),
    rx.text("This is a ", rx.text.strong("label"), " element.", as_="label"),
    rx.text("This is a ", rx.text.strong("div"), " element.", as_="div"),
    rx.text("This is a ", rx.text.strong("span"), " element.", as_="span"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)             
```

## Size

Use the `size` prop to control text size. This prop also provides correct line height and corrective letter spacing—as text size increases, the relative line height and letter spacing decrease.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="1"),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="2"),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="3"),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="4"),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="5"),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="6"),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="7"),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="8"),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="9"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

Sizes 2–4 are designed to work well for long-form content. Sizes 1–3 are designed to work well for UI labels.

## Weight

Use the `weight` prop to set the text weight.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", weight="light", as_="div"),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", weight="regular", as_="div"),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", weight="medium", as_="div"),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", weight="bold", as_="div"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

## Align

Use the `align` prop to set text alignment.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.text("Left-aligned", align="left", as_="div"),
    rx.text("Center-aligned", align="center", as_="div"),
    rx.text("Right-aligned", align="right", as_="div"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
    width="100%",
)
```

## Trim

Use the `trim` prop to trim the leading space at the start, end, or both sides of the text box.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.text("Without Trim",
        trim="normal",
        style={"background": "var(--gray-a2)",
                "border_top": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
                "border_bottom": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",}
    ),
    rx.text("With Trim",
        trim="both",
        style={"background": "var(--gray-a2)",
                "border_top": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
                "border_bottom": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",}
    ),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

Trimming the leading is useful when dialing in vertical spacing in cards or other “boxy” components. Otherwise, padding looks larger on top and bottom than on the sides.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.box(
        rx.heading("Without trim", margin_bottom="4px", size="3",),
        rx.text("The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant."),
        style={"background": "var(--gray-a2)", 
                "border": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",},
        padding="16px",
    ),
    rx.box(
        rx.heading("With trim", margin_bottom="4px", size="3", trim="start"),
        rx.text("The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant."),
        style={"background": "var(--gray-a2)", 
                "border": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",},
        padding="16px",
    ),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

## Color

Use the `color_scheme` prop to assign a specific color, ignoring the global theme.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="indigo"),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="cyan"),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="crimson"),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="orange"),
    direction="column",
)
```

## High Contrast

Use the `high_contrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="indigo", high_contrast=True),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="cyan", high_contrast=True),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="crimson", high_contrast=True),
    rx.text("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="orange", high_contrast=True),
    direction="column",
)
```

## With formatting

Compose `Text` with formatting components to add emphasis and structure to content.

```python demo
rx.text(
    "Look, such a helpful ",
    rx.link("link", href="#"),
    ", an ",
    rx.text.em("italic emphasis"),
    " a piece of computer ",
    rx.code("code"),
    ", and even a hotkey combination ",
    rx.text.kbd("⇧⌘A"),
    " within the text.",
    size="5",
)
```

## Preformmatting
By Default, the browser renders multiple white spaces into one. To preserve whitespace, use the `white_space = "pre"` css prop.

```python demo
rx.hstack(
    rx.text("This is not pre     formatted"),
    rx.text("This is pre     formatted", white_space="pre"),
)
```

## With form controls

Composing `text` with a form control like `checkbox`, `radiogroup`, or `switch` automatically centers the control with the first line of text, even when the text is multi-line.

```python demo
rx.box(
    rx.text(
        rx.flex(
            rx.checkbox(default_checked=True),
            "I understand that these documents are confidential and cannot be shared with a third party.",
        ),
        as_="label",
        size="3",
    ),
    style={"max_width": 300},
)
```


---
components:
    - rx.text.kbd
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# rx.text.kbd (Keyboard)

Represents keyboard input or a hotkey.

```python demo
rx.text.kbd("Shift + Tab")
```

## Size

Use the `size` prop to control text size. This prop also provides correct line height and corrective letter spacing—as text size increases, the relative line height and letter spacing decrease.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.text.kbd("Shift + Tab", size="1"),
    rx.text.kbd("Shift + Tab", size="2"),
    rx.text.kbd("Shift + Tab", size="3"),
    rx.text.kbd("Shift + Tab", size="4"),
    rx.text.kbd("Shift + Tab", size="5"),
    rx.text.kbd("Shift + Tab", size="6"),
    rx.text.kbd("Shift + Tab", size="7"),
    rx.text.kbd("Shift + Tab", size="8"),
    rx.text.kbd("Shift + Tab", size="9"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```


---
components:
    - rx.text.strong
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Strong

Marks text to signify strong importance.

```python demo
rx.text("The most important thing to remember is, ", rx.text.strong("stay positive"), ".")
```


---
components:
    - rx.heading
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Heading

```python demo
rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")
```

## As another element

Use the `as_` prop to change the heading level. This prop is purely semantic and does not change the visual appearance.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.heading("Level 1", as_="h1"),
    rx.heading("Level 2", as_="h2"),
    rx.heading("Level 3", as_="h3"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)             
```

## Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the heading. The prop also provides correct line height and corrective letter spacing—as text size increases, the relative line height and letter spacing decrease

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="1"),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="2"),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="3"),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="4"),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="5"),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="6"),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="7"),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="8"),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="9"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

## Weight

Use the `weight` prop to set the text weight.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", weight="light"),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", weight="regular"),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", weight="medium"),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", weight="bold"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

## Align

Use the `align` prop to set text alignment.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.heading("Left-aligned", align="left"),
    rx.heading("Center-aligned", align="center"),
    rx.heading("Right-aligned", align="right"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
    width="100%",
)
```

## Trim

Use the `trim` prop to trim the leading space at the start, end, or both sides of the text.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.heading("Without Trim",
        trim="normal",
        style={"background": "var(--gray-a2)",
                "border_top": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
                "border_bottom": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",}
    ),
    rx.heading("With Trim",
        trim="both",
        style={"background": "var(--gray-a2)",
                "border_top": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
                "border_bottom": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",}
    ),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

Trimming the leading is useful when dialing in vertical spacing in cards or other “boxy” components. Otherwise, padding looks larger on top and bottom than on the sides.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.box(
        rx.heading("Without trim", margin_bottom="4px", size="3",),
        rx.text("The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant."),
        style={"background": "var(--gray-a2)", 
                "border": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",},
        padding="16px",
    ),
    rx.box(
        rx.heading("With trim", margin_bottom="4px", size="3", trim="start"),
        rx.text("The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant."),
        style={"background": "var(--gray-a2)", 
                "border": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",},
        padding="16px",
    ),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

## Color

Use the `color_scheme` prop to assign a specific color, ignoring the global theme.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="indigo"),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="cyan"),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="crimson"),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="orange"),
    direction="column",
)
```

## High Contrast

Use the `high_contrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="indigo", high_contrast=True),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="cyan", high_contrast=True),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="crimson", high_contrast=True),
    rx.heading("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="orange", high_contrast=True),
    direction="column",
)
```


---
components:
    - rx.code
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Code

```python demo
rx.code("console.log()")
```

## Size

Use the `size` prop to control text size. This prop also provides correct line height and corrective letter spacing—as text size increases, the relative line height and letter spacing decrease.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.code("console.log()", size="1"),
    rx.code("console.log()", size="2"),
    rx.code("console.log()", size="3"),
    rx.code("console.log()", size="4"),
    rx.code("console.log()", size="5"),
    rx.code("console.log()", size="6"),
    rx.code("console.log()", size="7"),
    rx.code("console.log()", size="8"),
    rx.code("console.log()", size="9"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
    align="start",
)
```

## Weight

Use the `weight` prop to set the text weight.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.code("console.log()", weight="light"),
    rx.code("console.log()", weight="regular"),
    rx.code("console.log()", weight="medium"),
    rx.code("console.log()", weight="bold"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

## Variant

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.code("console.log()", variant="solid"),
    rx.code("console.log()", variant="soft"),
    rx.code("console.log()", variant="outline"),
    rx.code("console.log()", variant="ghost"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="2",
    align="start",
)
```

## Color

Use the `color_scheme` prop to assign a specific color, ignoring the global theme.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.code("console.log()", color_scheme="indigo"),
    rx.code("console.log()", color_scheme="crimson"),
    rx.code("console.log()", color_scheme="orange"),
    rx.code("console.log()", color_scheme="cyan"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="2",
    align="start",
)
```

## High Contrast

Use the `high_contrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.flex(
        rx.code("console.log()", variant="solid"),
        rx.code("console.log()", variant="soft"),
        rx.code("console.log()", variant="outline"),
        rx.code("console.log()", variant="ghost"),
        direction="column",
        align="start",
        spacing="2",
    ),
    rx.flex(
        rx.code("console.log()", variant="solid", high_contrast=True),
        rx.code("console.log()", variant="soft", high_contrast=True),
        rx.code("console.log()", variant="outline", high_contrast=True),
        rx.code("console.log()", variant="ghost", high_contrast=True),
        direction="column",
        align="start",
        spacing="2",
    ),
    spacing="3",
)
```


---
components:
    - rx.text.quote
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Quote

A short inline quotation.

```python demo
rx.text("His famous quote, ",
  rx.text.quote("Styles come and go. Good design is a language, not a style"),
  ", elegantly sums up Massimo’s philosophy of design."
  )
```


---
components:
    - rx.markdown
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Markdown

The `rx.markdown` component can be used to render markdown text.
It is based on [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.markdown("# Hello World!"),
    rx.markdown("## Hello World!"),
    rx.markdown("### Hello World!"),
    rx.markdown("Support us on [Github](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex)."),
    rx.markdown("Use `reflex deploy` to deploy your app with **a single command**."),
)
```

## Math Equations

You can render math equations using LaTeX.
For inline equations, surround the equation with `$`:

```python demo
rx.markdown("Pythagorean theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.")
```

## Syntax Highlighting

You can render code blocks with syntax highlighting using the \`\`\`\{language} syntax:

````python demo
rx.markdown(
r"""
```python
import reflex as rx
from .pages import index

app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index)
```
"""
)
````

## Tables

You can render tables using the `|` syntax:

```python demo
rx.markdown(
    """
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |
"""
)
```

## Plugins

Plugins can be used to extend the functionality of the markdown renderer.

By default Reflex uses the following plugins:
- `remark-gfm` for Github Flavored Markdown support (`use_gfm`).
- `remark-math` and `rehype-katex` for math equation support (`use_math`, `use_katex`).
- `rehype-unwrap-images` to remove paragraph tags around images (`use_unwrap_images`).
- `rehype-raw` to render raw HTML in markdown (`use_raw`). NOTE: in a future release this will be disabled by default for security reasons.

These default plugins can be disabled by passing `use_[plugin_name]=False` to the `rx.markdown` component. For example, to disable raw HTML rendering, use `rx.markdown(..., use_raw=False)`.

## Arbitrary Plugins

You can also add arbitrary remark or rehype plugins using the `remark_plugins`
and `rehype_plugins` props in conjunction with the `rx.markdown.plugin` helper.

`rx.markdown.plugin` takes two arguments:

1. The npm package name and version of the plugin (e.g. `remark-emoji@5.0.2`).
2. The named export to use from the plugin (e.g. `remarkEmoji`).

### Remark Plugin Example

For example, to add support for emojis using the `remark-emoji` plugin:

```python demo
rx.markdown(
    "Hello :smile:! :rocket: :tada:",
    remark_plugins=[
        rx.markdown.plugin("remark-emoji@5.0.2", "remarkEmoji"),
    ],
)
```

### Rehype Plugin Example

To make `rehype-raw` safer for untrusted HTML input we can use `rehype-sanitize`, which defaults to a safe schema similar to that used by Github.

```python demo
rx.markdown(
    """Here is some **bold** text and a <script>alert("XSS Attack!")</script>.""",
    use_raw=True,
    rehype_plugins=[
        rx.markdown.plugin("rehype-sanitize@5.0.1", "rehypeSanitize"),
    ],
)
```

### Plugin Options

Both `remark_plugins` and `rehype_plugins` accept a heterogeneous list of `plugin`
or tuple of `(plugin, options)` in case the plugin requires some kind of special
configuration.

For example, `rehype-slug` is a simple plugin that adds ID attributes to the
headings, but the `rehype-autolink-headings` plugin accepts options to specify
how to render the links to those anchors.

```python demo
rx.markdown(
    """
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
""",
    rehype_plugins=[
        rx.markdown.plugin("rehype-slug@6.0.0", "rehypeSlug"),
        (
            rx.markdown.plugin("rehype-autolink-headings@7.1.0", "rehypeAutolinkHeadings"),
            {
                "behavior": "wrap",
                "properties": {
                    "className": ["heading-link"],
                },
            },
        ),
    ],
)
```

## Component Map

You can specify which components to use for rendering markdown elements using the
`component_map` prop.

Each key in the `component_map` prop is a markdown element, and the value is
a function that takes the text of the element as input and returns a Reflex component.

```md alert
The `pre` and `a` tags are special cases. In addition to the `text`, they also receive a `props` argument containing additional props for the component.
```

````python demo exec
component_map = {
    "h1": lambda text: rx.heading(text, size="5", margin_y="1em"),
    "h2": lambda text: rx.heading(text, size="3", margin_y="1em"),
    "h3": lambda text: rx.heading(text, size="1", margin_y="1em"),
    "p": lambda text: rx.text(text, color="green", margin_y="1em"),
    "code": lambda text: rx.code(text, color="purple"),
    "pre": lambda text, **props: rx.code_block(text, **props, theme=rx.code_block.themes.dark, margin_y="1em"),
    "a": lambda text, **props: rx.link(text, **props, color="blue", _hover={"color": "red"}),
}

def index():
    return rx.box(
        rx.markdown(
r"""
# Hello World!

## This is a Subheader

### And Another Subheader

Here is some `code`:

```python
import reflex as rx

component = rx.text("Hello World!")
```

And then some more text here,
followed by a link to
[Reflex](https://reflex.dev/).
""",
    component_map=component_map,
)
    )
````


---
components:
    - rx.link
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import api_reference
```

# Link

Links are accessible elements used primarily for navigation. Use the `href` prop to specify the location for the link to navigate to.

```python demo
rx.link("Reflex Home Page.", href="https://reflex.dev/")
```

You can also provide local links to other pages in your project without writing the full url.

```python demo
rx.link("Example", href="/docs/library",)
```


The `link` component can be used to wrap other components to make them link to other pages.

```python demo
rx.link(rx.button("Example"), href="https://reflex.dev/")
```

You can also create anchors to link to specific parts of a page using the `id` prop.

```python demo
rx.box("Example", id="example")
```

To reference an anchor, you can use the `href` prop of the `link` component. The `href` should be in the format of the page you want to link to followed by a # and the id of the anchor.

```python demo
rx.link("Example", href="/docs/library/typography/link#example")
```

```md alert info
# Redirecting the user using State 
It is also possible to redirect the user to a new path within the application, using `rx.redirect()`. Check out the docs [here]({api_reference.special_events.path}).
```

# Style

## Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the link. The prop also provides correct line height and corrective letter spacing—as text size increases, the relative line height and letter spacing decrease.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="1"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="2"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="3"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="4"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="5"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="6"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="7"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="8"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", size="9"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

## Weight

Use the `weight` prop to set the text weight.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", weight="light"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", weight="regular"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", weight="medium"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", weight="bold"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

## Trim

Use the `trim` prop to trim the leading space at the start, end, or both sides of the rendered text.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.link("Without Trim",
        trim="normal",
        style={"background": "var(--gray-a2)",
                "border_top": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
                "border_bottom": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",}
    ),
    rx.link("With Trim",
        trim="both",
        style={"background": "var(--gray-a2)",
                "border_top": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
                "border_bottom": "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",}
    ),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

## Underline

Use the `underline` prop to manage the visibility of the underline affordance. It defaults to `auto`.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", underline="auto"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", underline="hover"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", underline="always"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

## Color

Use the `color_scheme` prop to assign a specific color, ignoring the global theme.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="indigo"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="cyan"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="crimson"),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", color_scheme="orange"),
    direction="column",
)
```

## High Contrast

Use the `high_contrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."),
    rx.link("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", high_contrast=True),
    direction="column",
)
```

# Dropdown Menu

A Dropdown Menu is a menu that offers a list of options that a user can select from. They are typically positioned near a button that will control their appearance and disappearance.

A Dropdown Menu is composed of a `menu.root`, a `menu.trigger` and a `menu.content`. The `menu.trigger` is the element that the user interacts with to open the menu. It wraps the element that will open the dropdown menu. The `menu.content` is the component that pops out when the dropdown menu is open.

The `menu.item` contains the actual dropdown menu items and sits under the `menu.content`. The `shortcut` prop is an optional shortcut command displayed next to the item text.

The `menu.sub` contains all the parts of a submenu. There is a `menu.sub_trigger`, which is an item that opens a submenu. It must be rendered inside a `menu.sub` component. The `menu.sub_component` is the component that pops out when a submenu is open. It must also be rendered inside a `menu.sub` component.

The `menu.separator` is used to visually separate items in a dropdown menu.

```python demo
rx.menu.root(
    rx.menu.trigger(
        rx.button("Options", variant="soft"),
    ),
    rx.menu.content(
        rx.menu.item("Edit", shortcut="⌘ E"),
        rx.menu.item("Duplicate", shortcut="⌘ D"),
        rx.menu.separator(),
        rx.menu.item("Archive", shortcut="⌘ N"),
        rx.menu.sub(
            rx.menu.sub_trigger("More"),
            rx.menu.sub_content(
                rx.menu.item("Move to project…"),
                rx.menu.item("Move to folder…"),
                rx.menu.separator(),
                rx.menu.item("Advanced options…"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.menu.separator(),
        rx.menu.item("Share"),
        rx.menu.item("Add to favorites"),
        rx.menu.separator(),
        rx.menu.item("Delete", shortcut="⌘ ⌫", color="red"),
    ),
)
```

## Events when the Dropdown Menu opens or closes

The `on_open_change` event, from the `menu.root`, is called when the `open` state of the dropdown menu changes. It is used in conjunction with the `open` prop, which is passed to the event handler.

```python demo exec
class DropdownMenuState(rx.State):
    num_opens: int = 0
    opened: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def count_opens(self, value: bool):
        self.opened = value
        self.num_opens += 1


def dropdown_menu_example():
    return rx.flex(
        rx.heading(f"Number of times Dropdown Menu opened or closed: {DropdownMenuState.num_opens}"),
        rx.heading(f"Dropdown Menu open: {DropdownMenuState.opened}"),
        rx.menu.root(
            rx.menu.trigger(
                rx.button("Options", variant="soft", size="2"),
            ),
            rx.menu.content(
                rx.menu.item("Edit", shortcut="⌘ E"),
                rx.menu.item("Duplicate", shortcut="⌘ D"),
                rx.menu.separator(),
                rx.menu.item("Archive", shortcut="⌘ N"),
                rx.menu.separator(),
                rx.menu.item("Delete", shortcut="⌘ ⌫", color="red"),
            ),
            on_open_change=DropdownMenuState.count_opens,
        ),
        direction="column",
        spacing="3",
    )
```

## Opening a Dialog from Menu using State

Accessing an overlay component from within another overlay component is a common use case but does not always work exactly as expected.

The code below will not work as expected as because the dialog is within the menu and the dialog will only be open when the menu is open, rendering the dialog unusable.

```python
rx.menu.root(
    rx.menu.trigger(rx.icon("ellipsis-vertical")),
    rx.menu.content(
        rx.menu.item(
            rx.dialog.root(
            rx.dialog.trigger(rx.text("Edit")),
            rx.dialog.content(....),
            .....
            ),
        ),
    ),
)
```

In this example, we will show how to open a dialog box from a dropdown menu, where the menu will close and the dialog will open and be functional.

```python demo exec
class DropdownMenuState2(rx.State):
    which_dialog_open: str = ""

    @rx.event
    def set_which_dialog_open(self, value: str):
        self.which_dialog_open = value

    @rx.event
    def delete(self):
        yield rx.toast("Deleted item")

    @rx.event
    def save_settings(self):
        yield rx.toast("Saved settings")


def delete_dialog():
    return rx.alert_dialog.root(
        rx.alert_dialog.content(
            rx.alert_dialog.title("Are you Sure?"),
            rx.alert_dialog.description(
                rx.text(
                    "This action cannot be undone. Are you sure you want to delete this item?",
                ),
                margin_bottom="20px",
            ),
            rx.hstack(
                rx.alert_dialog.action(
                    rx.button(
                        "Delete",
                        color_scheme="red",
                        on_click=DropdownMenuState2.delete,
                    ),
                ),
                rx.spacer(),
                rx.alert_dialog.cancel(rx.button("Cancel")),
            ),
        ),
        open=DropdownMenuState2.which_dialog_open == "delete",
        on_open_change=DropdownMenuState2.set_which_dialog_open(""),
    )


def settings_dialog():
    return rx.dialog.root(
        rx.dialog.content(
            rx.dialog.title("Settings"),
            rx.dialog.description(
                rx.text("Set your settings in this settings dialog."),
                margin_bottom="20px",
            ),
            rx.dialog.close(
                rx.button("Close", on_click=DropdownMenuState2.save_settings),
            ),
        ),
        open=DropdownMenuState2.which_dialog_open == "settings",
        on_open_change=DropdownMenuState2.set_which_dialog_open(""),
    )


def menu_call_dialog() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.menu.root(
            rx.menu.trigger(rx.icon("menu")),
            rx.menu.content(
                rx.menu.item(
                    "Delete",
                    on_click=DropdownMenuState2.set_which_dialog_open("delete"),
                ),
                rx.menu.item(
                    "Settings",
                    on_click=DropdownMenuState2.set_which_dialog_open("settings"),
                ),
            ),
        ),
        rx.cond(
            DropdownMenuState2.which_dialog_open,
            rx.heading(f"{DropdownMenuState2.which_dialog_open} dialog is open"),
        ),
        delete_dialog(),

# Alert Dialog

An alert dialog is a modal confirmation dialog that interrupts the user and expects a response.

The `alert_dialog.root` contains all the parts of the dialog.

The `alert_dialog.trigger` wraps the control that will open the dialog.

The `alert_dialog.content` contains the content of the dialog.

The `alert_dialog.title` is the title that is announced when the dialog is opened.

The `alert_dialog.description` is an optional description that is announced when the dialog is opened.

The `alert_dialog.action` wraps the control that will close the dialog. This should be distinguished visually from the `alert_dialog.cancel` control.

The `alert_dialog.cancel` wraps the control that will close the dialog. This should be distinguished visually from the `alert_dialog.action` control.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.alert_dialog.root(
    rx.alert_dialog.trigger(
        rx.button("Revoke access"),
    ),
    rx.alert_dialog.content(
        rx.alert_dialog.title("Revoke access"),
        rx.alert_dialog.description(
            "Are you sure? This application will no longer be accessible and any existing sessions will be expired.",
        ),
        rx.flex(
            rx.alert_dialog.cancel(
                rx.button("Cancel"),
            ),
            rx.alert_dialog.action(
                rx.button("Revoke access"),
            ),
            spacing="3",
        ),
    ),
)
```

This example has a different color scheme and the `cancel` and `action` buttons are right aligned.

```python demo
rx.alert_dialog.root(
    rx.alert_dialog.trigger(
        rx.button("Revoke access", color_scheme="red"),
    ),
    rx.alert_dialog.content(
        rx.alert_dialog.title("Revoke access"),
        rx.alert_dialog.description(
            "Are you sure? This application will no longer be accessible and any existing sessions will be expired.",
            size="2",
        ),
        rx.flex(
            rx.alert_dialog.cancel(
                rx.button("Cancel", variant="soft", color_scheme="gray"),
            ),
            rx.alert_dialog.action(
                rx.button("Revoke access", color_scheme="red", variant="solid"),
            ),
            spacing="3",
            margin_top="16px",
            justify="end",
        ),
        style={"max_width": 450},
    ),
)
```

Use the `inset` component to align content flush with the sides of the dialog.

```python demo
rx.alert_dialog.root(
    rx.alert_dialog.trigger(
        rx.button("Delete Users", color_scheme="red"),
    ),
    rx.alert_dialog.content(
        rx.alert_dialog.title("Delete Users"),
        rx.alert_dialog.description(
            "Are you sure you want to delete these users? This action is permanent and cannot be undone.",
            size="2",
        ),
        rx.inset(
            rx.table.root(
                rx.table.header(
                    rx.table.row(
                        rx.table.column_header_cell("Full Name"),
                        rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                        rx.table.column_header_cell("Group"),
                    ),
                ),
                rx.table.body(
                    rx.table.row(
                        rx.table.row_header_cell("Danilo Rosa"),
                        rx.table.cell("danilo@example.com"),
                        rx.table.cell("Developer"),
                    ),
                    rx.table.row(
                        rx.table.row_header_cell("Zahra Ambessa"),
                        rx.table.cell("zahra@example.com"),
                        rx.table.cell("Admin"),
                    ),
                ),
            ),
            side="x",
            margin_top="24px",
            margin_bottom="24px",
        ),
        rx.flex(
            rx.alert_dialog.cancel(
                rx.button("Cancel", variant="soft", color_scheme="gray"),
            ),
            rx.alert_dialog.action(
                rx.button("Delete users", color_scheme="red"),
            ),
            spacing="3",
            justify="end",
        ),
        style={"max_width": 500},
    ),
)
```

## Events when the Alert Dialog opens or closes

The `on_open_change` event is called when the `open` state of the dialog changes. It is used in conjunction with the `open` prop.

```python demo exec
class AlertDialogState(rx.State):
    num_opens: int = 0
    opened: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def count_opens(self, value: bool):
        self.opened = value
        self.num_opens += 1


def alert_dialog():
    return rx.flex(
        rx.heading(f"Number of times alert dialog opened or closed: {AlertDialogState.num_opens}"),
        rx.heading(f"Alert Dialog open: {AlertDialogState.opened}"),
        rx.alert_dialog.root(
            rx.alert_dialog.trigger(
                rx.button("Revoke access", color_scheme="red"),
            ),
            rx.alert_dialog.content(
                rx.alert_dialog.title("Revoke access"),
                rx.alert_dialog.description(
                    "Are you sure? This application will no longer be accessible and any existing sessions will be expired.",
                    size="2",
                ),
                rx.flex(
                    rx.alert_dialog.cancel(
                        rx.button("Cancel", variant="soft", color_scheme="gray"),
                    ),
                    rx.alert_dialog.action(
                        rx.button("Revoke access", color_scheme="red", variant="solid"),
                    ),
                    spacing="3",
                    margin_top="16px",
                    justify="end",
                ),

## Controlling Alert Dialog with State

This example shows how to control whether the dialog is open or not with state. This is an easy way to show the dialog without needing to use the `rx.alert_dialog.trigger`.

`rx.alert_dialog.root` has a prop `open` that can be set to a boolean value to control whether the dialog is open or not.

We toggle this `open` prop with a button outside of the dialog and the `rx.alert_dialog.cancel` and `rx.alert_dialog.action` buttons inside the dialog.

```python demo exec
class AlertDialogState2(rx.State):
    opened: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def dialog_open(self):
        self.opened = ~self.opened


def alert_dialog2():
    return rx.box(
            rx.alert_dialog.root(
        rx.alert_dialog.content(
            rx.alert_dialog.title("Revoke access"),
            rx.alert_dialog.description(
                "Are you sure? This application will no longer be accessible and any existing sessions will be expired.",
            ),
            rx.flex(
                rx.alert_dialog.cancel(
                    rx.button("Cancel", on_click=AlertDialogState2.dialog_open),
                ),
                rx.alert_dialog.action(
                    rx.button("Revoke access", on_click=AlertDialogState2.dialog_open),
                ),
                spacing="3",
            ),
        ),
        open=AlertDialogState2.opened,
    ),
    rx.button("Button to Open the Dialog", on_click=AlertDialogState2.dialog_open),
)
```


## Form Submission to a Database from an Alert Dialog

This example adds new users to a database from an alert dialog using a form.

1. It defines a User1 model with name and email fields.
2. The `add_user_to_db` method adds a new user to the database, checking for existing emails.
3. On form submission, it calls the `add_user_to_db` method.
4. The UI component has:
- A button to open an alert dialog
- An alert dialog containing a form to add a new user
- Input fields for name and email
- Submit and Cancel buttons


```python demo exec
class User1(rx.Model, table=True):
    """The user model."""
    name: str
    email: str

class State(rx.State):
   
    current_user: User1 = User1()

    @rx.event
    def add_user_to_db(self, form_data: dict):
        self.current_user = form_data
        ### Uncomment the code below to add your data to a database ###
        # with rx.session() as session:
        #     if session.exec(
        #         select(User1).where(user.email == self.current_user["email"])
        #     ).first():
        #         return rx.window_alert("User with this email already exists")
        #     session.add(User1(**self.current_user))
        #     session.commit()
        
        return rx.toast.info(f"User {self.current_user['name']} has been added.", position="bottom-right")


def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.alert_dialog.root(
        rx.alert_dialog.trigger(
            rx.button(
                rx.icon("plus", size=26),
                rx.text("Add User", size="4"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.alert_dialog.content(
            rx.alert_dialog.title(
                "Add New User",
            ),
            rx.alert_dialog.description(
                "Fill the form with the user's info",
            ),
            rx.form(
                rx.flex(
                    rx.input(
                        placeholder="User Name", name="name"
                    ),
                    rx.input(
                        placeholder="user@reflex.dev", name="email"
                    ),
                    rx.flex(
                        rx.alert_dialog.cancel(
                            rx.button(
                                "Cancel",
                                variant="soft",
                                color_scheme="gray",

                            rx.button("Submit", type="submit"),
                        ),

# Toast

A `rx.toast` is a non-blocking notification that disappears after a certain amount of time. It is often used to show a message to the user without interrupting their workflow.

## Usage

You can use `rx.toast` as an event handler for any component that triggers an action.

```python demo
rx.button("Show Toast", on_click=rx.toast("Hello, World!"))
```

### Usage in State

You can also use `rx.toast` in a state to show a toast when a specific action is triggered, using `yield`.

```python demo exec
import asyncio
class ToastState(rx.State):

    @rx.event
    async def fetch_data(self):
        # Simulate fetching data for a 2-second delay
        await asyncio.sleep(2)
        # Shows a toast when the data is fetched
        yield rx.toast("Data fetched!")


def render():
    return rx.button("Get Data", on_click=ToastState.fetch_data)
```

## Interaction

If you want to interact with a toast, a few props are available to customize the behavior.

By passing a `ToastAction` to the `action` or `cancel` prop, you can trigger an action when the toast is clicked or when it is closed.

```python demo
rx.button("Show Toast", on_click=rx.toast("Hello, World!", duration=5000, close_button=True))
```

### Presets

`rx.toast` has some presets that you can use to show different types of toasts.

```python demo
rx.hstack(
    rx.button("Success", on_click=rx.toast.success("Success!"), color_scheme="green"),
    rx.button("Error", on_click=rx.toast.error("Error!"), color_scheme="red"),
    rx.button("Warning", on_click=rx.toast.warning("Warning!"), color_scheme="orange"),
    rx.button("Info", on_click=rx.toast.info("Info!"), color_scheme="blue"),
)
```

### Customization

If the presets don't fit your needs, you can customize the toasts by passing to `rx.toast` or to `rx.toast.options` some kwargs.

```python demo
rx.button(
    "Custom",
    on_click=rx.toast(
        "Custom Toast!",
        position="top-right",
        style={"background-color": "green", "color": "white", "border": "1px solid green", "border-radius": "0.53m"}
    )
)
```

The following props are available for customization:

- `description`: `str | Var`: Toast's description, renders underneath the title.
- `close_button`: `bool`: Whether to show the close button.
- `invert`: `bool`: Dark toast in light mode and vice versa.
- `important`: `bool`: Control the sensitivity of the toast for screen readers.
- `duration`: `int`: Time in milliseconds that should elapse before automatically closing the toast.
- `position`: `LiteralPosition`: Position of the toast.
- `dismissible`: `bool`: If false, it'll prevent the user from dismissing the toast.
- `action`: `ToastAction`: Renders a primary button, clicking it will close the toast.
- `cancel`: `ToastAction`: Renders a secondary button, clicking it will close the toast.
- `id`: `str | Var`: Custom id for the toast.
- `unstyled`: `bool`: Removes the default styling, which allows for easier customization.
- `style`: `Style`: Custom style for the toast.
- `on_dismiss`: `Any`: The function gets called when either the close button is clicked, or the toast is swiped.
- `on_auto_close`: `Any`: Function that gets called when the toast disappears automatically after it's timeout (`duration` prop).

## Toast Provider

Using the `rx.toast` function require to have a toast provider in your app.

`rx.toast.provider` is a component that provides a context for displaying toasts. It should be placed at the root of your app.

```md alert warning
# In most case you will not need to include this component directly, as it is already included in `rx.app` as the `overlay_component` for displaying connections errors.
```

# Hovercard

The `hover_card.root` contains all the parts of a hover card.

The `hover_card.trigger` wraps the link that will open the hover card.

The `hover_card.content` contains the content of the open hover card.

```python demo
rx.text(

            style={"width": 360},
        ),
    ),
)
```

## Events when the Hovercard opens or closes

The `on_open_change` event is called when the `open` state of the hovercard changes. It is used in conjunction with the `open` prop, which is passed to the event handler.

```python demo exec
class HovercardState(rx.State):
    num_opens: int = 0
    opened: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def count_opens(self, value: bool):
        self.opened = value
        self.num_opens += 1


def hovercard_example():
    return rx.flex(
        rx.heading(f"Number of times hovercard opened or closed: {HovercardState.num_opens}"),
        rx.heading(f"Hovercard open: {HovercardState.opened}"),
        rx.text(
            "Hover over the text to see the hover card. ",
            rx.hover_card.root(
                rx.hover_card.trigger(
                    rx.link("Hover over me", color_scheme="blue", underline="always"),
                ),
                rx.hover_card.content(
                    rx.text("This is the tooltip content."),
                ),
                on_open_change=HovercardState.count_opens,
            ),
        ),
        direction="column",

## Sidebar Menu with a Drawer and State

This example shows how to create a sidebar menu with a drawer. The drawer is opened by clicking a button. The drawer contains links to different sections of the page. When a link is clicked the drawer closes and the page scrolls to the section.

The `rx.drawer.root` component has an `open` prop that is set by the state variable `is_open`. Setting the `modal` prop to `False` allows the user to interact with the rest of the page while the drawer is open and allows the page to be scrolled when a user clicks one of the links.

```python demo exec
class DrawerState(rx.State):
    is_open: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def toggle_drawer(self):
        self.is_open = not self.is_open

def drawer_content():
    return rx.drawer.content(
        rx.flex(
            rx.drawer.close(rx.button("Close", on_click=DrawerState.toggle_drawer)),
            rx.link("Link 1", href="#test1", on_click=DrawerState.toggle_drawer),
            rx.link("Link 2", href="#test2", on_click=DrawerState.toggle_drawer),
            align_items="start",
            direction="column",
        ),
        height="100%",
        width="20%",
        padding="2em",
        background_color=rx.color("grass", 7),
    )


def lateral_menu():
    return rx.drawer.root(
        rx.drawer.trigger(rx.button("Open Drawer", on_click=DrawerState.toggle_drawer)),
        rx.drawer.overlay(),
        rx.drawer.portal(drawer_content()),
        open=DrawerState.is_open,
        direction="left",
        modal=False,
    )

def drawer_sidebar():
    return rx.vstack(
        lateral_menu(),
        rx.section(
            rx.heading("Test1", size="8"),
            id='test1',
            height="400px",
        ),
        rx.section(
            rx.heading("Test2", size="8"),
            id='test2',
            height="400px",

# Popover

A popover displays content, triggered by a button.

The `popover.root` contains all the parts of a popover.

The `popover.trigger` contains the button that toggles the popover.

The `popover.content` is the component that pops out when the popover is open.

The `popover.close` is the button that closes an open popover.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.popover.root(
    rx.popover.trigger(
        rx.button("Popover"),
    ),
    rx.popover.content(
        rx.flex(
            rx.text("Simple Example"),
            rx.popover.close(
                rx.button("Close"),
            ),
            direction="column",
            spacing="3",
        ),
    ),
)
```

## Examples in Context

```python demo

rx.popover.root(
    rx.popover.trigger(
        rx.button("Comment", variant="soft"),
    ),
    rx.popover.content(
        rx.flex(
            rx.avatar(
                "2",
                fallback="RX",
                radius="full"
            ),
            rx.box(
                rx.text_area(placeholder="Write a comment…", style={"height": 80}),
                rx.flex(
                    rx.checkbox("Send to group"),
                    rx.popover.close(

            padding_top="12px",
        ),
        style={"width": 360},
    )
)
```

## Popover with dynamic title

Code like below will not work as expected and it is necessary to place the dynamic title (`Index2State.language`) inside of an `rx.text` component.

```python
class Index2State(rx.State):
    language: str = "EN"

def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.popover.root(
        rx.popover.trigger(
            rx.button(Index2State.language),
        ),
        rx.popover.content(
            rx.text('Success')
        )
    )
```

This code will work:

```python demo exec
class Index2State(rx.State):
    language: str = "EN"

def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.popover.root(
        rx.popover.trigger(
            rx.button(
                rx.text(Index2State.language)
            ),
        ),
        rx.popover.content(
            rx.text('Success')
        )
    )
```

## Events when the Popover opens or closes

The `on_open_change` event is called when the `open` state of the popover changes. It is used in conjunction with the `open` prop, which is passed to the event handler.

```python demo exec
class PopoverState(rx.State):
    num_opens: int = 0
    opened: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def count_opens(self, value: bool):
        self.opened = value
        self.num_opens += 1


def popover_example():
    return rx.flex(
        rx.heading(f"Number of times popover opened or closed: {PopoverState.num_opens}"),
        rx.heading(f"Popover open: {PopoverState.opened}"),
        rx.popover.root(
            rx.popover.trigger(
                rx.button("Popover"),
            ),
            rx.popover.content(
                rx.flex(
                    rx.text("Simple Example"),
                    rx.popover.close(
                        rx.button("Close"),
                    ),
                    direction="column",
                    spacing="3",
                ),
            ),
            on_open_change=PopoverState.count_opens,
        ),
        direction="column",
        spacing="3",
    )
```

# Tooltip

A `tooltip` displays informative information when users hover over or focus on an element.

It takes a `content` prop, which is the content associated with the tooltip.

```python demo

```

## Events when the Tooltip opens or closes

The `on_open_change` event is called when the `open` state of the tooltip changes. It is used in conjunction with the `open` prop, which is passed to the event handler.

# Dialog

The `dialog.root` contains all the parts of a dialog.

The `dialog.trigger` wraps the control that will open the dialog.

The `dialog.content` contains the content of the dialog.

The `dialog.title` is a title that is announced when the dialog is opened.

The `dialog.description` is a description that is announced when the dialog is opened.

The `dialog.close` wraps the control that will close the dialog.

```python demo
rx.dialog.root(
    rx.dialog.trigger(rx.button("Open Dialog")),
    rx.dialog.content(
        rx.dialog.title("Welcome to Reflex!"),
        rx.dialog.description(
            "This is a dialog component. You can render anything you want in here.",
        ),
        rx.dialog.close(
            rx.button("Close Dialog", size="3"),

## Form Submission to a Database from a Dialog

This example adds new users to a database from a dialog using a form.

1. It defines a User model with name and email fields.
2. The `add_user_to_db` method adds a new user to the database, checking for existing emails.
3. On form submission, it calls the `add_user_to_db` method.
4. The UI component has:

- A button to open a dialog
- A dialog containing a form to add a new user
- Input fields for name and email
- Submit and Cancel buttons

```python demo exec
class User(rx.Model, table=True):
    """The user model."""
    name: str
    email: str

class State(rx.State):

    current_user: User = User()

    @rx.event
    def add_user_to_db(self, form_data: dict):
        self.current_user = form_data
        ### Uncomment the code below to add your data to a database ###
        # with rx.session() as session:
        #     if session.exec(
        #         select(User).where(user.email == self.current_user["email"])
        #     ).first():
        #         return rx.window_alert("User with this email already exists")
        #     session.add(User(**self.current_user))
        #     session.commit()

        return rx.toast.info(f"User {self.current_user['name']} has been added.", position="bottom-right")

# Context Menu

A Context Menu is a popup menu that appears upon user interaction, such as a right-click or a hover.

## Basic Usage

A Context Menu is composed of a `context_menu.root`, a `context_menu.trigger` and a `context_menu.content`. The `context_menu_root` contains all the parts of a context menu. The `context_menu.trigger` is the element that the user interacts with to open the menu. It wraps the element that will open the context menu. The `context_menu.content` is the component that pops out when the context menu is open.

The `context_menu.item` contains the actual context menu items and sits under the `context_menu.content`.

The `context_menu.sub` contains all the parts of a submenu. There is a `context_menu.sub_trigger`, which is an item that opens a submenu. It must be rendered inside a `context_menu.sub` component. The `context_menu.sub_content` is the component that pops out when a submenu is open. It must also be rendered inside a `context_menu.sub` component.

The `context_menu.separator` is used to visually separate items in a context menu.

```python demo
rx.context_menu.root(
    rx.context_menu.trigger(
       rx.button("Right click me"),
    ),
    rx.context_menu.content(
        rx.context_menu.item("Edit", shortcut="⌘ E"),
        rx.context_menu.item("Duplicate", shortcut="⌘ D"),
        rx.context_menu.separator(),
        rx.context_menu.item("Archive", shortcut="⌘ N"),
        rx.context_menu.sub(
            rx.context_menu.sub_trigger("More"),
            rx.context_menu.sub_content(
                rx.context_menu.item("Move to project…"),
                rx.context_menu.item("Move to folder…"),
                rx.context_menu.separator(),
                rx.context_menu.item("Advanced options…"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.context_menu.separator(),
        rx.context_menu.item("Share"),
        rx.context_menu.item("Add to favorites"),
        rx.context_menu.separator(),
        rx.context_menu.item("Delete", shortcut="⌘ ⌫", color="red"),
    ),
)
```

````md alert warning
# `rx.context_menu.item` must be a DIRECT child of `rx.context_menu.content`

The code below for example is not allowed:

```python
rx.context_menu.root(
    rx.context_menu.trigger(
       rx.button("Right click me"),
    ),
    rx.context_menu.content(
        rx.cond(
            State.count % 2 == 0,
            rx.vstack(
                rx.context_menu.item("Even Option 1", on_click=State.set_selected_option("Even Option 1")),
                rx.context_menu.item("Even Option 2", on_click=State.set_selected_option("Even Option 2")),
                rx.context_menu.item("Even Option 3", on_click=State.set_selected_option("Even Option 3")),
            ),
            rx.vstack(
                rx.context_menu.item("Odd Option A", on_click=State.set_selected_option("Odd Option A")),
                rx.context_menu.item("Odd Option B", on_click=State.set_selected_option("Odd Option B")),
                rx.context_menu.item("Odd Option C", on_click=State.set_selected_option("Odd Option C")),
            )
        )
    ),
)
```
````

## Opening a Dialog from Context Menu using State

Accessing an overlay component from within another overlay component is a common use case but does not always work exactly as expected.

The code below will not work as expected as because the dialog is within the menu and the dialog will only be open when the menu is open, rendering the dialog unusable.

```python
rx.context_menu.root(
    rx.context_menu.trigger(rx.icon("ellipsis-vertical")),
    rx.context_menu.content(
        rx.context_menu.item(
            rx.dialog.root(
            rx.dialog.trigger(rx.text("Edit")),
            rx.dialog.content(....),
            .....
            ),
        ),
    ),
)
```

In this example, we will show how to open a dialog box from a context menu, where the menu will close and the dialog will open and be functional.

```python demo exec
class ContextMenuState(rx.State):
    which_dialog_open: str = ""

    @rx.event
    def set_which_dialog_open(self, value: str):
        self.which_dialog_open = value

    @rx.event
    def delete(self):
        yield rx.toast("Deleted item")

    @rx.event
    def save_settings(self):
        yield rx.toast("Saved settings")


def delete_dialog():
    return rx.alert_dialog.root(
        rx.alert_dialog.content(
            rx.alert_dialog.title("Are you Sure?"),
            rx.alert_dialog.description(
                rx.text(
                    "This action cannot be undone. Are you sure you want to delete this item?",
                ),
                margin_bottom="20px",
            ),
            rx.hstack(
                rx.alert_dialog.action(
                    rx.button(
                        "Delete",
                        color_scheme="red",
                        on_click=ContextMenuState.delete,
                    ),
                ),
                rx.spacer(),
                rx.alert_dialog.cancel(rx.button("Cancel")),
            ),
        ),
        open=ContextMenuState.which_dialog_open == "delete",
        on_open_change=ContextMenuState.set_which_dialog_open(""),
    )


def settings_dialog():
    return rx.dialog.root(
        rx.dialog.content(
            rx.dialog.title("Settings"),
            rx.dialog.description(
                rx.text("Set your settings in this settings dialog."),
                margin_bottom="20px",
            ),
            rx.dialog.close(
                rx.button("Close", on_click=ContextMenuState.save_settings),
            ),
        ),
        open=ContextMenuState.which_dialog_open == "settings",
        on_open_change=ContextMenuState.set_which_dialog_open(""),
    )


def context_menu_call_dialog() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.context_menu.root(
            rx.context_menu.trigger(rx.icon("ellipsis-vertical")),
            rx.context_menu.content(
                rx.context_menu.item(
                    "Delete",
                    on_click=ContextMenuState.set_which_dialog_open("delete"),
                ),
                rx.context_menu.item(
                    "Settings",
                    on_click=ContextMenuState.set_which_dialog_open("settings"),
                ),
            ),
        ),
        rx.cond(
            ContextMenuState.which_dialog_open,
            rx.heading(f"{ContextMenuState.which_dialog_open} dialog is open"),
        ),
        delete_dialog(),
        settings_dialog(),
        align="center",

# Match

The `rx.match` feature in Reflex serves as a powerful alternative to `rx.cond` for handling conditional statements.
While `rx.cond` excels at conditionally rendering two components based on a single condition,
`rx.match` extends this functionality by allowing developers to handle multiple conditions and their associated components.
This feature is especially valuable when dealing with intricate conditional logic or nested scenarios,
where the limitations of `rx.cond` might lead to less readable and more complex code.

With `rx.match`, developers can not only handle multiple conditions but also perform structural pattern matching,
making it a versatile tool for managing various scenarios in Reflex applications.

## Basic Usage

The `rx.match` function provides a clear and expressive syntax for handling multiple
conditions and their corresponding components:

```python
rx.match(
    condition,
    (case_1, component_1),
    (case_2, component_2),
    ...
    default_component,
)

```

- `condition`: The value to match against.
- `(case_i, component_i)`: A Tuple of matching cases and their corresponding return components.
- `default_component`: A special case for the default component when the condition isn't matched by any of the match cases.

Example

```python demo exec
from typing import List

import reflex as rx


class MatchState(rx.State):
    cat_breed: str = ""
    animal_options: List[str] = ["persian", "siamese", "maine coon", "ragdoll", "pug", "corgi"]

    @rx.event
    def set_cat_breed(self, breed: str):
        self.cat_breed = breed

def match_demo():
    return rx.flex(
        rx.match(
            MatchState.cat_breed,
            ("persian", rx.text("Persian cat selected.")),
            ("siamese", rx.text("Siamese cat selected.")),
            ("maine coon", rx.text("Maine Coon cat selected.")),
            ("ragdoll", rx.text("Ragdoll cat selected.")),
            rx.text("Unknown cat breed selected.")
        ),
        rx.select.root(
            rx.select.trigger(),
            rx.select.content(
                rx.select.group(
                    rx.foreach(MatchState.animal_options, lambda x: rx.select.item(x, value=x))
                ),
            ),
            value=MatchState.cat_breed,
            on_change=MatchState.set_cat_breed,

        ),
        direction= "column",
        gap= "2"
    )
```

## Default Case

The default case in `rx.match` serves as a universal handler for scenarios where none of
the specified match cases aligns with the given match condition. Here are key considerations
when working with the default case:

- **Placement in the Match Function**: The default case must be the last non-tuple argument in the `rx.match` component.
  All match cases should be enclosed in tuples; any non-tuple value is automatically treated as the default case. For example:

```python
rx.match(
           MatchState.cat_breed,
           ("persian", rx.text("persian cat selected")),
           rx.text("Unknown cat breed selected."),
           ("siamese", rx.text("siamese cat selected")),
       )
```

The above code snippet will result in an error due to the misplaced default case.

- **Single Default Case**: Only one default case is allowed in the `rx.match` component.
  Attempting to specify multiple default cases will lead to an error. For instance:

```python
rx.match(
           MatchState.cat_breed,
           ("persian", rx.text("persian cat selected")),
           ("siamese", rx.text("siamese cat selected")),
           rx.text("Unknown cat breed selected."),
           rx.text("Another unknown cat breed selected.")
       )
```

- **Optional Default Case for Component Return Values**: If the match cases in a `rx.match` component
  return components, the default case can be optional. In this scenario, if a default case is
  not provided, `rx.fragment` will be implicitly assigned as the default. For example:

```python
rx.match(
           MatchState.cat_breed,
           ("persian", rx.text("persian cat selected")),
           ("siamese", rx.text("siamese cat selected")),
       )
```

In this case, `rx.fragment` is the default case. However, not providing a default case for non-component
return values will result in an error:

```python
rx.match(
           MatchState.cat_breed,
           ("persian", "persian cat selected"),
           ("siamese", "siamese cat selected"),
       )
```

The above code snippet will result in an error as a default case must be explicitly
provided in this scenario.

## Handling Multiple Conditions

`rx.match` excels in efficiently managing multiple conditions and their corresponding components,
providing a cleaner and more readable alternative compared to nested `rx.cond` structures.

Consider the following example:

```python demo exec
from typing import List

import reflex as rx


class MultiMatchState(rx.State):
    animal_breed: str = ""
    animal_options: List[str] = ["persian", "siamese", "maine coon", "pug", "corgi", "mustang", "rahvan", "football", "golf"]

    @rx.event
    def set_animal_breed(self, breed: str):
        self.animal_breed = breed

def multi_match_demo():
    return rx.flex(
        rx.match(
            MultiMatchState.animal_breed,
            ("persian", "siamese", "maine coon", rx.text("Breeds of cats.")),
            ("pug", "corgi", rx.text("Breeds of dogs.")),
            ("mustang", "rahvan", rx.text("Breeds of horses.")),
            rx.text("Unknown animal breed")
        ),
        rx.select.root(
            rx.select.trigger(),
            rx.select.content(
                rx.select.group(
                    rx.foreach(MultiMatchState.animal_options, lambda x: rx.select.item(x, value=x))
                ),
            ),
            value=MultiMatchState.animal_breed,
            on_change=MultiMatchState.set_animal_breed,

        ),
        direction= "column",
        gap= "2"
    )
```

In a match case tuple, you can specify multiple conditions. The last value of the match case
tuple is automatically considered as the return value. It's important to note that a match case
tuple should contain a minimum of two elements: a match case and a return value.
The following code snippet will result in an error:

```python
rx.match(
            MatchState.cat_breed,
            ("persian",),
            ("maine coon", rx.text("Maine Coon cat selected")),
        )
```

## Usage as Props

Similar to `rx.cond`, `rx.match` can be used as prop values, allowing dynamic behavior for UI components:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx


class MatchPropState(rx.State):
    value: int = 0

    @rx.event
    def incr(self):
        self.value += 1

    @rx.event
    def decr(self):
        self.value -= 1


def match_prop_demo_():
    return rx.flex(
        rx.button("decrement", on_click=MatchPropState.decr, background_color="red"),
        rx.badge(
            MatchPropState.value,
            color_scheme= rx.match(
                    MatchPropState.value,
                    (1, "red"),
                    (2, "blue"),
                    (6, "purple"),
                    (10, "orange"),
                    "green"
                ),
                size="2",
        ),
        rx.button("increment", on_click=MatchPropState.incr),
        align_items="center",
        direction= "row",
        gap= "3"
    )
```

In the example above, the background color property of the box component containing `State.value` changes to red when
`state.value` is 1, blue when its 5, green when its 5, orange when its 15 and black for any other value.

The example below also shows handling multiple conditions with the match component as props.

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx


class MatchMultiPropState(rx.State):
    value: int = 0

    @rx.event
    def incr(self):
        self.value += 1

    @rx.event
    def decr(self):
        self.value -= 1


def match_multi_prop_demo_():
    return rx.flex(
        rx.button("decrement", on_click=MatchMultiPropState.decr, background_color="red"),
        rx.badge(
            MatchMultiPropState.value,
            color_scheme= rx.match(
                    MatchMultiPropState.value,
                    (1, 3, 9, "red"),
                    (2, 4, 5, "blue"),
                    (6, 8, 12, "purple"),
                    (10, 15, 20, 25, "orange"),
                    "green"
                ),
                size="2",
        ),
        rx.button("increment", on_click=MatchMultiPropState.incr),
        align_items="center",

# Usage with Structural Pattern Matching

The `rx.match` component is designed for structural pattern matching. If the value of your match condition evaluates to a boolean (True or False), it is recommended to use `rx.cond` instead.

Consider the following example, which is more suitable for `rx.cond`:\*
```

```python
rx.cond(
    MatchPropState.value == 10,
    "true value",
    "false value"
)
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Auto Scroll

The `rx.auto_scroll` component is a div that automatically scrolls to the bottom when new content is added. This is useful for chat interfaces, logs, or any container where new content is dynamically added and you want to ensure the most recent content is visible.

## Basic Usage

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx

class AutoScrollState(rx.State):
    messages: list[str] = ["Initial message"]
    
    def add_message(self):
        self.messages.append(f"New message #{len(self.messages) + 1}")

def auto_scroll_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.auto_scroll(
            rx.foreach(
                AutoScrollState.messages,
                lambda message: rx.box(
                    message,
                    padding="0.5em",
                    border_bottom="1px solid #eee",
                    width="100%"
                )
            ),
            height="200px",
            width="300px",
            border="1px solid #ddd",
            border_radius="md",
        ),
        rx.button("Add Message", on_click=AutoScrollState.add_message),
        width="300px",
        align_items="center",
    )
```

The `auto_scroll` component automatically scrolls to show the newest content when it's added. In this example, each time you click "Add Message", a new message is added to the list and the container automatically scrolls to display it.

## When to Use Auto Scroll

- **Chat applications**: Keep the chat window scrolled to the most recent messages.
- **Log viewers**: Automatically follow new log entries as they appear.
- **Feed interfaces**: Keep the newest content visible in dynamically updating feeds.

## Props

`rx.auto_scroll` is based on the `rx.div` component and inherits all of its props. By default, it sets `overflow="auto"` to enable scrolling.

Some common props you might use with `auto_scroll`:

- `height`: Set the height of the scrollable container.
- `width`: Set the width of the scrollable container.
- `padding`: Add padding inside the container.
- `border`: Add a border around the container.
- `border_radius`: Round the corners of the container.

## How It Works

The component tracks when new content is added and maintains the scroll position in two scenarios:

1. When the user is already near the bottom of the content (within 50 pixels), it will scroll to the bottom when new content is added.
2. When the container didn't have a scrollbar before but does now (due to new content), it will automatically scroll to the bottom.

This behavior ensures that users can scroll up to view older content without being forced back to the bottom, while still automatically following new content in most cases.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Foreach

The `rx.foreach` component takes an iterable(list, tuple or dict) and a function that renders each item in the list.
This is useful for dynamically rendering a list of items defined in a state.

```md alert warning
# `rx.foreach` is specialized for usecases where the iterable is defined in a state var.

For an iterable where the content doesn't change at runtime, i.e a constant, using a list/dict comprehension instead of `rx.foreach` is preferred.
```

```python demo exec
from typing import List
class ForeachState(rx.State):
    color: List[str] = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "orange", "purple"]

def colored_box(color: str):
    return rx.box(
        rx.text(color),
        bg=color
    )

def foreach_example():
    return rx.grid(
        rx.foreach(
            ForeachState.color,
            colored_box
        ),
        columns="2",
    )
```

The function can also take an index as a second argument.

```python demo exec
def colored_box_index(color: str, index: int):
    return rx.box(
        rx.text(index),
        bg=color
    )

def foreach_example_index():
    return rx.grid(
        rx.foreach(
            ForeachState.color,
            lambda color, index: colored_box_index(color, index)
        ),
        columns="2",
    )
```

Nested foreach components can be used to render nested lists.

When indexing into a nested list, it's important to declare the list's type as Reflex requires it for type checking.
This ensures that any potential frontend JS errors are caught before the user can encounter them.

```python demo exec
from typing import List

class NestedForeachState(rx.State):
    numbers: List[List[str]] = [["1", "2", "3"], ["4", "5", "6"], ["7", "8", "9"]]

def display_row(row):
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.foreach(
            row,
            lambda item: rx.box(
                item,
                border="1px solid black",
                padding="0.5em",
            )
        ),
    )

def nested_foreach_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.foreach(
             NestedForeachState.numbers,
            display_row
        )
    )
```

Below is a more complex example of foreach within a todo list.

```python demo exec
from typing import List
class ListState(rx.State):
    items: List[str] = ["Write Code", "Sleep", "Have Fun"]
    new_item: str

    @rx.event
    def set_new_item(self, new_item: str):
        self.new_item = new_item

    @rx.event
    def add_item(self):
        self.items += [self.new_item]

    def finish_item(self, item: str):
        self.items = [i for i in self.items if i != item]

def get_item(item):
    return rx.list.item(
        rx.hstack(
            rx.button(
                on_click=lambda: ListState.finish_item(item),
                height="1.5em",
                background_color="white",
                border="1px solid blue",
            ),
            rx.text(item, font_size="1.25em"),
        ),
    )

def todo_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading("Todos"),
        rx.input(on_blur=ListState.set_new_item, placeholder="Add a todo...", bg  = "white"),
        rx.button("Add", on_click=ListState.add_item, bg = "white"),
        rx.divider(),
        rx.list.ordered(
            rx.foreach(
                ListState.items,
                get_item,
            ),
        ),
        bg = "#ededed",
        padding = "1em",
        border_radius = "0.5em",
        shadow = "lg"
    )
```

## Dictionaries

Items in a dictionary can be accessed as list of key-value pairs.
Using the color example, we can slightly modify the code to use dicts as shown below.

```python demo exec
from typing import List
class SimpleDictForeachState(rx.State):
    color_chart: dict[int, str] = {
         1 : "blue",
         2: "red",
         3: "green"
    }

def display_color(color: List):
    # color is presented as a list key-value pair([1, "blue"],[2, "red"], [3, "green"])
    return rx.box(rx.text(color[0]), bg=color[1])


def foreach_dict_example():
    return rx.grid(
        rx.foreach(
            SimpleDictForeachState.color_chart,
            display_color
        ),
        columns = "2"
    )
```

Now let's show a more complex example with dicts using the color example.
Assuming we want to display a dictionary of secondary colors as keys and their constituent primary colors as values, we can modify the code as below:

```python demo exec
from typing import List, Dict
class ComplexDictForeachState(rx.State):
    color_chart: Dict[str, List[str]] = {
        "purple": ["red", "blue"],
        "orange": ["yellow", "red"],
        "green": ["blue", "yellow"]
    }

def display_colors(color: List):
    return rx.vstack(
            rx.text(color[0], color=color[0]),
            rx.hstack(
                rx.foreach(
                    color[1], lambda x: rx.box(rx.text(x, color="black"), bg=x)
                )

            )
        )

def foreach_complex_dict_example():
    return rx.grid(
        rx.foreach(
            ComplexDictForeachState.color_chart,
            display_colors
        ),
        columns="2"
    )
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Cond

This component is used to conditionally render components.

The cond component takes a condition and two components.
If the condition is `True`, the first component is rendered, otherwise the second component is rendered.

```python demo exec
class CondState(rx.State):
    show: bool = True

    @rx.event
    def change(self):
        self.show = not (self.show)


def cond_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.button("Toggle", on_click=CondState.change),
        rx.cond(CondState.show, rx.text("Text 1", color="blue"), rx.text("Text 2", color="red")),
    )
```

The second component is optional and can be omitted.
If it is omitted, nothing is rendered if the condition is `False`.

```python demo exec
class CondOptionalState(rx.State):
    show_optional: bool = True

    @rx.event
    def toggle_optional(self):
        self.show_optional = not (self.show_optional)


def cond_optional_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.button("Toggle", on_click=CondOptionalState.toggle_optional),
        rx.cond(CondOptionalState.show_optional, rx.text("This text appears when condition is True", color="green")),
        rx.text("This text is always visible", color="gray"),
    )
```

```md video https://youtube.com/embed/ITOZkzjtjUA?start=6040&end=6463
# Video: Conditional Rendering
```

## Negation

You can use the logical operator `~` to negate a condition.

```python
rx.vstack(
    rx.button("Toggle", on_click=CondState.change),
    rx.cond(CondState.show, rx.text("Text 1", color="blue"), rx.text("Text 2", color="red")),
    rx.cond(~CondState.show, rx.text("Text 1", color="blue"), rx.text("Text 2", color="red")),
)
```

## Multiple Conditions

It is also possible to make up complex conditions using the `logical or` (|) and `logical and` (&) operators.

Here we have an example using the var operators `>=`, `<=`, `&`. We define a condition that if a person has an age between 18 and 65, including those ages, they are able to work, otherwise they cannot.

We could equally use the operator `|` to represent a `logical or` in one of our conditions.

```python demo exec
import random

class CondComplexState(rx.State):
    age: int = 19

    @rx.event
    def change(self):
        self.age = random.randint(0, 100)


def cond_complex_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.button("Toggle", on_click=CondComplexState.change),
        rx.text(f"Age: {CondComplexState.age}"),
        rx.cond(
            (CondComplexState.age >= 18) & (CondComplexState.age <=65),
            rx.text("You can work!", color="green"),
            rx.text("You cannot work!", color="red"),
        ),
    )

```

## Nested Conditional

We can also nest `cond` components within each other to create more complex logic. In python we can have an `if` statement that then has several `elif` statements before finishing with an `else`. This is also possible in reflex using nested `cond` components. In this example we check whether a number is positive, negative or zero.

Here is the python logic using `if` statements:

```python
number = 0

if number > 0:
    print("Positive number")

elif number == 0:
    print('Zero')
else:
    print('Negative number')
```

This reflex code that is logically identical:

```python demo exec
import random


class NestedState(rx.State):

    num: int = 0

    def change(self):
        self.num = random.randint(-10, 10)


def cond_nested_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.button("Toggle", on_click=NestedState.change),
        rx.cond(
            NestedState.num > 0,
            rx.text(f"{NestedState.num} is Positive!", color="orange"),
            rx.cond(
                NestedState.num == 0,
                rx.text(f"{NestedState.num} is Zero!", color="blue"),
                rx.text(f"{NestedState.num} is Negative!", color="red"),
            )
        ),
    )

```

Here is a more advanced example where we have three numbers and we are checking which of the three is the largest. If any two of them are equal then we return that `Some of the numbers are equal!`.

The reflex code that follows is logically identical to doing the following in python:

```python
a = 8
b = 10
c = 2

if((a>b and a>c) and (a != b and a != c)):
 print(a, " is the largest!")
elif((b>a and b>c) and (b != a and b != c)):
 print(b, " is the largest!")
elif((c>a and c>b) and (c != a and c != b)):
 print(c, " is the largest!")
else:
 print("Some of the numbers are equal!")
```


---
components:
  - rx.grid
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Grid

Component for creating grid layouts. Either `rows` or `columns` may be specified.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.grid(
    rx.foreach(
        rx.Var.range(12),
        lambda i: rx.card(f"Card {i + 1}", height="10vh"),
    ),
    columns="3",
    spacing="4",
    width="100%",
)
```

```python demo
rx.grid(
    rx.foreach(
        rx.Var.range(12),
        lambda i: rx.card(f"Card {i + 1}", height="10vh"),
    ),
    rows="3",
    flow="column",
    justify="between",
    spacing="4",
    width="100%",
)
```


---
components:
  - rx.container
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Container

Constrains the maximum width of page content, while keeping flexible margins
for responsive layouts.

A Container is generally used to wrap the main content for a page.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.box(
    rx.container(
        rx.card("This content is constrained to a max width of 448px.", width="100%"),
        size="1",
    ),
    rx.container(
        rx.card("This content is constrained to a max width of 688px.", width="100%"),
        size="2",
    ),
    rx.container(
        rx.card("This content is constrained to a max width of 880px.", width="100%"),
        size="3",
    ),
    rx.container(
        rx.card("This content is constrained to a max width of 1136px.", width="100%"),
        size="4",
    ),
    background_color="var(--gray-3)",
    width="100%",
)
```


---
components:
  - rx.box
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Box

Box is a generic container component that can be used to group other components.

By default, the Box component is based on the `div` and rendered as a block element. It's primary use is for applying styles.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.box(
    rx.box("CSS color", background_color="yellow", border_radius="2px", width="20%", margin="4px", padding="4px"),
    rx.box("CSS color", background_color="orange", border_radius="5px", width="40%", margin="8px", padding="8px"),
    rx.box("Radix Color", background_color="var(--tomato-3)", border_radius="5px", width="60%", margin="12px", padding="12px"),
    rx.box("Radix Color", background_color="var(--plum-3)", border_radius="10px", width="80%", margin="16px", padding="16px"),
    rx.box("Radix Theme Color", background_color="var(--accent-2)", radius="full", width="100%", margin="24px", padding="25px"),
    flex_grow="1",
    text_align="center",
)
```

## Background

To set a background [image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_images) or
[gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_images/Using_CSS_gradients),
use the [`background` CSS prop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background).

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.box(background="linear-gradient(45deg, var(--tomato-9), var(--plum-9))", width="20%", height="100%"),
    rx.box(background="linear-gradient(red, yellow, blue, orange)", width="20%", height="100%"),
    rx.box(background="radial-gradient(at 0% 30%, red 10px, yellow 30%, #1e90ff 50%)", width="20%", height="100%"),
    rx.box(background="center/cover url('/reflex_banner.png')", width="20%", height="100%"),
    spacing="2",
    width="100%",
    height="10vh",
)
```


---
components:
    - rx.center
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Center

`Center` is a component that centers its children within itself. It is based on the `flex` component and therefore inherits all of its props.

```python demo
rx.center(
    rx.text("Hello World!"),
    border_radius="15px",
    border_width="thick",
    width="50%",
)
```


---
components:
    - rx.fragment
---

# Fragment

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb import constants
```

A Fragment is a Component that allow you to group multiple Components without a wrapper node.

Refer to the React docs at [React/Fragment]({constants.FRAGMENT_COMPONENT_INFO_URL}) for more information on its use-case.

```python demo
rx.fragment(
    rx.text("Component1"), 
    rx.text("Component2")
)
```


```md video https://youtube.com/embed/ITOZkzjtjUA?start=3196&end=3340

---
components:
    - rx.separator
Separator: |
    lambda **props: rx.separator(**props)

---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Separator

Visually or semantically separates content.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.card("Section 1"),
    rx.divider(),
    rx.card("Section 2"),
    spacing="4",
    direction="column",
    align="center",
)
```

## Size

The `size` prop controls how long the separator is. Using `size="4"` will make
the separator fill the parent container. Setting CSS `width` or `height` prop to `"100%"`
can also achieve this effect, but `size` works the same regardless of the orientation.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.card("Section 1"),
    rx.divider(size="4"),
    rx.card("Section 2"),
    spacing="4",
    direction="column",
)
```

## Orientation

Setting the orientation prop to `vertical` will make the separator appear vertically.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.card("Section 1"),
    rx.divider(orientation="vertical", size="4"),
    rx.card("Section 2"),
    spacing="4",
    width="100%",
    height="10vh",
)
```


---
components:
  - rx.section
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Section

Denotes a section of page content, providing vertical padding by default.

Primarily this is a semantic component that is used to group related textual content.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.box(
    rx.section(
        rx.heading("First"),
        rx.text("This is the first content section"),
        padding_left="12px",
        padding_right="12px",
        background_color="var(--gray-2)",
    ),
    rx.section(
        rx.heading("Second"),
        rx.text("This is the second content section"),
        padding_left="12px",
        padding_right="12px",
        background_color="var(--gray-2)",
    ),
    width="100%",
)
```


---
components:
  - rx.aspect_ratio
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Aspect Ratio

Displays content with a desired ratio.

## Basic Example

Setting the `ratio` prop will adjust the width or height
of the content such that the `width` divided by the `height` equals the `ratio`.
For responsive scaling, set the `width` or `height` of the content to `"100%"`.

```python demo
rx.grid(
    rx.aspect_ratio(
        rx.box(
            "Widescreen 16:9",
            background_color="papayawhip",
            width="100%",
            height="100%",
        ),
        ratio=16 / 9,
    ),
    rx.aspect_ratio(
        rx.box(
            "Letterbox 4:3",
            background_color="orange",
            width="100%",
            height="100%",
        ),
        ratio=4 / 3,
    ),
    rx.aspect_ratio(
        rx.box(
            "Square 1:1",
            background_color="green",
            width="100%",
            height="100%",
        ),
        ratio=1,
    ),
    rx.aspect_ratio(
        rx.box(
            "Portrait 5:7",
            background_color="lime",
            width="100%",
            height="100%",
        ),
        ratio=5 / 7,
    ),
    spacing="2",
    width="25%",
)

# Never set `height` or `width` directly on an `aspect_ratio` component or its contents.

Instead, wrap the `aspect_ratio` in a `box` that constrains either the width or the height, then set the content width and height to `"100%"`.
```

```python demo
rx.flex(
    *[
        rx.box(
            rx.aspect_ratio(
                rx.image(src="/logo.jpg", width="100%", height="100%"),
                ratio=ratio,
            ),
            width="20%",
        )
        for ratio in [16 / 9, 3 / 2, 2 / 3, 1]
    ],
    justify="between",
    width="100%",
)
```

components:
    - rx.spacer
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Spacer

Creates an adjustable, empty space that can be used to tune the spacing between child elements within `flex`.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.center(rx.text("Example"), bg="lightblue"),
    rx.spacer(),
    rx.center(rx.text("Example"), bg="lightgreen"),
    rx.spacer(),
    rx.center(rx.text("Example"), bg="salmon"),
    width="100%",
)
```

As `stack`, `vstack` and `hstack` are all built from `flex`, it is possible to also use `spacer` inside of these components.

components:
    - rx.inset

Inset: |
    lambda **props: rx.card(
        rx.inset(
            rx.image(src="/reflex_banner.png", height="auto"),
            **props,
        ),
        width="500px",
    )
    
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Inset

Applies a negative margin to allow content to bleed into the surrounding container.

## Basic Example

Nesting an Inset component inside a Card will render the content from edge to edge of the card.

```python demo
rx.card(
    rx.inset(
        rx.image(src="/reflex_banner.png", width="100%", height="auto"),
        side="top",
        pb="current",
    ),
    rx.text("Reflex is a web framework that allows developers to build their app in pure Python."),
    width="25vw",
)
```

## Other Directions

The `side` prop controls which side the negative margin is applied to. When using a specific side,
it is helpful to set the padding for the opposite side to `current` to retain the same padding the
content would have had if it went to the edge of the parent component.

```python demo
rx.card(
    rx.text("The inset below uses a bottom side."),
    rx.inset(
        rx.image(src="/reflex_banner.png", width="100%", height="auto"),
        side="bottom",
        pt="current",
    ),
    width="25vw",
)
```

```python demo
rx.card(
    rx.flex(
        rx.text("This inset uses a right side, which requires a flex with direction row."),
        rx.inset(
            rx.box(background="center/cover url('/reflex_banner.png')", height="100%"),
            width="100%",
            side="right",
            pl="current",
        ),
        direction="row",
        width="100%",
    ),
    width="25vw",
)
```

```python demo
rx.card(
    rx.flex(
        rx.inset(
            rx.box(background="center/cover url('/reflex_banner.png')", height="100%"),
            width="100%",
            side="left",
            pr="current",
        ),
        rx.text("This inset uses a left side, which also requires a flex with direction row."),
        direction="row",
        width="100%",
    ),
    width="25vw",
)

# Card

A Card component is used for grouping related components. It is similar to the Box, except it has a
border, uses the theme colors and border radius, and provides a `size` prop to control spacing
and margin according to the Radix `"1"` - `"5"` scale.

The Card requires less styling than a Box to achieve consistent visual results when used with
themes.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.card("Card 1", size="1"),
    rx.card("Card 2", size="2"),
    rx.card("Card 3", size="3"),
    rx.card("Card 4", size="4"),
    rx.card("Card 5", size="5"),
    spacing="2",
    align_items="flex-start",
    flex_wrap="wrap",
)
```

## Rendering as a Different Element

The `as_child` prop may be used to render the Card as a different element. Link and Button are
commonly used to make a Card clickable.

```python demo
rx.card(
    rx.link(
        rx.flex(
            rx.avatar(src="/reflex_banner.png"),
            rx.box(
                rx.heading("Quick Start"),
                rx.text("Get started with Reflex in 5 minutes."),
            ),
            spacing="2",
        ),
    ),
    as_child=True,
)
```

## Using Inset Content


---
components:
  - rx.flex
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Flex

The Flex component is used to make [flexbox layouts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox).
It makes it simple to arrange  child components in horizontal or vertical directions, apply wrapping,
justify and align  content, and automatically size components based on available space, making it
ideal for building responsive layouts.

By default, children are arranged horizontally (`direction="row"`) without wrapping.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.card("Card 1"),
    rx.card("Card 2"),
    rx.card("Card 3"),
    rx.card("Card 4"),
    rx.card("Card 5"),
    spacing="2",
    width="100%",
)
```

## Wrapping

With `flex_wrap="wrap"`, the children will wrap to the next line instead of being resized.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.foreach(
        rx.Var.range(10),
        lambda i: rx.card(f"Card {i + 1}", width="16%"),
    ),
    spacing="2",
    flex_wrap="wrap",
    width="100%",
)
```

## Direction

With `direction="column"`, the children will be arranged vertically.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.card("Card 1"),
    rx.card("Card 2"),
    rx.card("Card 3"),
    rx.card("Card 4"),
    spacing="2",
    direction="column",
)
```

## Alignment

Two props control how children are aligned within the Flex component:

* `align` controls how children are aligned along the cross axis (vertical for `row` and horizontal for `column`).
* `justify` controls how children are aligned along the main axis (horizontal for `row` and vertical for `column`).

The following example visually demonstrates the effect of these props with different `wrap` and `direction` values.

```python demo exec
class FlexPlaygroundState(rx.State):
    align: str = "stretch"
    justify: str = "start"
    direction: str = "row"
    wrap: str = "nowrap"

    @rx.event
    def set_align(self, value: str):
        self.align = value

    @rx.event
    def set_justify(self, value: str):
        self.justify = value

    @rx.event
    def set_direction(self, value: str):
        self.direction = value

    @rx.event
    def set_wrap(self, value: str):
        self.wrap = value


def select(label, items, value, on_change):
    return rx.flex(
        rx.text(label),
        rx.select.root(
            rx.select.trigger(),
            rx.select.content(
                *[
                    rx.select.item(item, value=item)
                    for item in items
                ]
            ),
            value=value,
            on_change=on_change,
        ),
        align="center",
        justify="center",
        direction="column",
    )


def selectors():
    return rx.flex(
        select("Wrap", ["nowrap", "wrap", "wrap-reverse"], FlexPlaygroundState.wrap, FlexPlaygroundState.set_wrap),
        select("Direction", ["row", "column", "row-reverse", "column-reverse"], FlexPlaygroundState.direction, FlexPlaygroundState.set_direction),
        select("Align", ["start", "center", "end", "baseline", "stretch"], FlexPlaygroundState.align, FlexPlaygroundState.set_align),
        select("Justify", ["start", "center", "end", "between"], FlexPlaygroundState.justify, FlexPlaygroundState.set_justify),
        width="100%",
        spacing="2",
        justify="between",
    )


def example1():
    return rx.box(
        selectors(),
        rx.flex(
            rx.foreach(
                rx.Var.range(10),
                lambda i: rx.card(f"Card {i + 1}", width="16%"),
            ),
            spacing="2",
            direction=FlexPlaygroundState.direction,
            align=FlexPlaygroundState.align,
            justify=FlexPlaygroundState.justify,
            wrap=FlexPlaygroundState.wrap,
            width="100%",
            height="20vh",
            margin_top="16px",
        ),
        width="100%",
    )
```

## Size Hinting

When a child component is included in a flex container,
the `flex_grow` (default `"0"`) and `flex_shrink` (default `"1"`) props control
how the box is sized relative to other components in the same container.

The resizing always applies to the main axis of the flex container. If the direction is
`row`, then the sizing applies to the `width`. If the direction is `column`, then the sizing
applies to the `height`. To set the optimal size along the main axis, the `flex_basis` prop
is used and may be either a percentage or CSS size units. When unspecified, the
corresponding `width` or `height` value is used if set, otherwise the content size is used.

When `flex_grow="0"`, the box will not grow beyond the `flex_basis`.

When `flex_shrink="0"`, the box will not shrink to less than the `flex_basis`.

These props are used when creating flexible responsive layouts.

Move the slider below and see how adjusting the width of the flex container
affects the computed  sizes of the flex items based on the props that are set.

```python demo exec
class FlexGrowShrinkState(rx.State):
    width_pct: list[int] = [100]

    @rx.event
    def set_width_pct(self, value: list[int | float]):
        self.width_pct = [int(value[0])]


def border_box(*children, **props):
    return rx.box(
        *children,
        border="1px solid var(--gray-10)",
        border_radius="2px",
        **props,
    )


def example2():
    return rx.box(
        rx.flex(
            border_box("flex_shrink=0", flex_shrink="0", width="100px"),
            border_box("flex_shrink=1", flex_shrink="1", width="200px"),
            border_box("flex_grow=0", flex_grow="0"),
            border_box("flex_grow=1", flex_grow="1"),
            width=f"{FlexGrowShrinkState.width_pct}%",
            margin_bottom="16px",
            spacing="2",
        ),
        rx.slider(
            min=0,
            max=100,
            value=FlexGrowShrinkState.width_pct,
            on_change=FlexGrowShrinkState.set_width_pct,
        ),
        width="100%",
    )
```

# Stack

`Stack` is a layout component used to group elements together and apply a space between them.

`vstack` is used to stack elements in the vertical direction.

`hstack` is used to stack elements in the horizontal direction.

`stack` is used to stack elements in the vertical or horizontal direction.

These components are based on the `flex` component and therefore inherit all of its props.

The `stack` component can be used with the `flex_direction` prop to set to either `row` or `column` to set the direction.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.stack(
        rx.box(
            "Example",
            bg="orange",

# Accordion

An accordion is a vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each reveal an associated section of content.
The accordion component is made up of `accordion`, which is the root of the component and takes in an `accordion.item`,
which contains all the contents of the collapsible section.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.accordion.root(
    rx.accordion.item(header="First Item", content="The first accordion item's content"),
    rx.accordion.item(
        header="Second Item", content="The second accordion item's content",
    ),
    rx.accordion.item(header="Third item", content="The third accordion item's content"),
    width="300px",
)
```

## Styling

### Type

We use the `type` prop to determine whether multiple items can be opened at once. The allowed values for this prop are
`single` and `multiple` where `single` will only open one item at a time. The default value for this prop is `single`.

```python demo
rx.accordion.root(
    rx.accordion.item(header="First Item", content="The first accordion item's content"),
    rx.accordion.item(
        header="Second Item", content="The second accordion item's content",
    ),
    rx.accordion.item(header="Third item", content="The third accordion item's content"),
    collapsible=True,
    width="300px",
    type="multiple",
)
```

### Default Value

We use the `default_value` prop to specify which item should open by default. The value for this prop should be any of the
unique values set by an `accordion.item`.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.accordion.root(
        rx.accordion.item(
            header="First Item",
            content="The first accordion item's content",
            value="item_1",
        ),
        rx.accordion.item(
            header="Second Item",
            content="The second accordion item's content",
            value="item_2",
        ),
        rx.accordion.item(
            header="Third item",
            content="The third accordion item's content",
            value="item_3",
        ),
        width="300px",
        default_value="item_2",
    ),
    direction="row",
    spacing="2"
)
```

### Collapsible

We use the `collapsible` prop to allow all items to close. If set to `False`, an opened item cannot be closed.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.accordion.root(
        rx.accordion.item(header="First Item", content="The first accordion item's content"),
        rx.accordion.item(header="Second Item", content="The second accordion item's content"),
        rx.accordion.item(header="Third item", content="The third accordion item's content"),
        collapsible=True,
        width="300px",
    ),
    rx.accordion.root(
        rx.accordion.item(header="First Item", content="The first accordion item's content"),
        rx.accordion.item(header="Second Item", content="The second accordion item's content"),
        rx.accordion.item(header="Third item", content="The third accordion item's content"),
        collapsible=False,
        width="300px",
    ),
    direction="row",
    spacing="2"
)
```

### Disable

We use the `disabled` prop to prevent interaction with the accordion and all its items.

```python demo
rx.accordion.root(
    rx.accordion.item(header="First Item", content="The first accordion item's content"),
    rx.accordion.item(header="Second Item", content="The second accordion item's content"),
    rx.accordion.item(header="Third item", content="The third accordion item's content"),
    collapsible=True,
    width="300px",
    disabled=True,
)
```

### Orientation

We use `orientation` prop to set the orientation of the accordion to `vertical` or `horizontal`. By default, the orientation
will be set to `vertical`. Note that, the orientation prop won't change the visual orientation but the
functional orientation of the accordion. This means that for vertical orientation, the up and down arrow keys moves focus between the next or previous item,
while for horizontal orientation, the left or right arrow keys moves focus between items.

```python demo

    ),
    rx.accordion.item(header="Third item", content="The third accordion item's content"),
    collapsible=True,
    width="300px",
    orientation="vertical",
)
```

```python demo
rx.accordion.root(
    rx.accordion.item(header="First Item", content="The first accordion item's content"),
    rx.accordion.item(
        header="Second Item", content="The second accordion item's content",
    ),
    rx.accordion.item(header="Third item", content="The third accordion item's content"),
    collapsible=True,

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.accordion.root(

        rx.accordion.item(
            header="Second Item", content="The second accordion item's content",
        ),
        rx.accordion.item(header="Third item", content="The third accordion item's content"),
        collapsible=True,
        variant="classic",
    ),
    rx.accordion.root(
        rx.accordion.item(header="First Item", content="The first accordion item's content"),
        rx.accordion.item(
            header="Second Item", content="The second accordion item's content",
        ),
        rx.accordion.item(header="Third item", content="The third accordion item's content"),
        collapsible=True,
        variant="soft",
    ),
    rx.accordion.root(
        rx.accordion.item(header="First Item", content="The first accordion item's content"),
        rx.accordion.item(
            header="Second Item", content="The second accordion item's content",
        ),
        rx.accordion.item(header="Third item", content="The third accordion item's content"),
        collapsible=True,
        variant="outline",
    ),
    rx.accordion.root(
        rx.accordion.item(header="First Item", content="The first accordion item's content"),
        rx.accordion.item(
            header="Second Item", content="The second accordion item's content",
        ),
        rx.accordion.item(header="Third item", content="The third accordion item's content"),
        collapsible=True,
        variant="surface",
    ),
    rx.accordion.root(
        rx.accordion.item(header="First Item", content="The first accordion item's content"),
        rx.accordion.item(
            header="Second Item", content="The second accordion item's content",
        ),
        rx.accordion.item(header="Third item", content="The third accordion item's content"),
        collapsible=True,
        variant="ghost",
    ),
    direction="row",
    spacing="2"
)
```

### Color Scheme

We use the `color_scheme` prop to assign a specific color to the accordion background, ignoring the global theme.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.accordion.root(
        rx.accordion.item(header="First Item", content="The first accordion item's content"),
        rx.accordion.item(
            header="Second Item", content="The second accordion item's content",
        ),
        rx.accordion.item(header="Third item", content="The third accordion item's content"),
        collapsible=True,
        width="300px",
        color_scheme="grass",
    ),
    rx.accordion.root(
        rx.accordion.item(header="First Item", content="The first accordion item's content"),
        rx.accordion.item(
            header="Second Item", content="The second accordion item's content",
        ),
        rx.accordion.item(header="Third item", content="The third accordion item's content"),
        collapsible=True,
        width="300px",
        color_scheme="green",
    ),
    direction="row",
    spacing="2"
)
```

### Value

We use the `value` prop to specify the controlled value of the accordion item that we want to activate.
This property should be used in conjunction with the `on_value_change` event argument.

```python demo exec
class AccordionState(rx.State):
    """The app state."""
    value: str = "item_1"
    item_selected: str

    @rx.event
    def change_value(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.item_selected = f"{value} selected"


def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.theme(
        rx.container(
            rx.text(AccordionState.item_selected),
            rx.flex(
                rx.accordion.root(
                    rx.accordion.item(
                        header="Is it accessible?",
                        content=rx.button("Test button"),
                        value="item_1",
                    ),
                    rx.accordion.item(
                        header="Is it unstyled?",
                        content="Yes. It's unstyled by default, giving you freedom over the look and feel.",
                        value="item_2",
                    ),
                    rx.accordion.item(
                        header="Is it finished?",
                        content="It's still in beta, but it's ready to use in production.",
                        value="item_3",
                    ),
                    collapsible=True,
                    width="300px",
                    value=AccordionState.value,
                    on_value_change=lambda value: AccordionState.change_value(value),
                ),
                direction="column",
                spacing="2",
            ),
            padding="2em",
            text_align="center",
        )
    )
```

## AccordionItem

The accordion item contains all the parts of a collapsible section.

    ),
    rx.accordion.item(

components:
    - rx.segmented_control.root
    - rx.segmented_control.item
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx

class SegmentedState(rx.State):
    """The app state."""

    control: str = "test"

    @rx.event
    def set_control(self, value: str | list[str]):
        self.control = value


```

# Segmented Control

Segmented Control offers a clear and accessible way to switch between predefined values and views, e.g., "Inbox," "Drafts," and "Sent."

With Segmented Control, you can make mutually exclusive choices, where only one option can be active at a time, clear and accessible. Without Segmented Control, end users might have to deal with controls like dropdowns or multiple buttons that don't clearly convey state or group options together visually.

## Basic Example

The `Segmented Control` component is made up of a `rx.segmented_control.root` which groups `rx.segmented_control.item`.

The `rx.segmented_control.item` components define the individual segments of the control, each with a label and a unique value.

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.segmented_control.root(
        rx.segmented_control.item("Home", value="home"),
        rx.segmented_control.item("About", value="about"),
        rx.segmented_control.item("Test", value="test"),
        on_change=SegmentedState.set_control,
        value=SegmentedState.control,
    ),
    rx.card(
        rx.text(SegmentedState.control, align="left"),
        rx.text(SegmentedState.control, align="center"),
        rx.text(SegmentedState.control, align="right"),
        width="100%",
    ),
)
```

**In the example above:**

`on_change` is used to specify a callback function that will be called when the user selects a different segment. In this case, the `SegmentedState.setvar("control")` function is used to update the `control` state variable when the user changes the selected segment.

`value` prop is used to specify the currently selected segment, which is bound to the `SegmentedState.control` state variable.

# Tabs

Tabs are a set of layered sections of content—known as tab panels that are displayed one at a time.
They facilitate the organization and navigation between sets of content that share a connection and exist at a similar level of hierarchy.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.tabs.root(
    rx.tabs.list(
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 1", value="tab1"),
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 2", value="tab2")
    ),
    rx.tabs.content(
        rx.text("item on tab 1"),
        value="tab1",
    ),
    rx.tabs.content(
        rx.text("item on tab 2"),
        value="tab2",
    ),
)

```

The `tabs` component is made up of a `rx.tabs.root` which groups `rx.tabs.list` and `rx.tabs.content` parts.

## Styling

### Default value

We use the `default_value` prop to set a default active tab, this will select the specified tab by default.

```python demo
rx.tabs.root(
    rx.tabs.list(
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 1", value="tab1"),
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 2", value="tab2")
    ),
    rx.tabs.content(
        rx.text("item on tab 1"),
        value="tab1",
    ),
    rx.tabs.content(
        rx.text("item on tab 2"),
        value="tab2",
    ),
    default_value="tab2",
)
```

### Orientation

We use `orientation` prop to set the orientation of the tabs component to `vertical` or `horizontal`. By default, the orientation
will be set to `horizontal`. Setting this value will change both the visual orientation and the functional orientation.

```md alert info
The functional orientation means for `vertical`, the `up` and `down` arrow keys moves focus between the next or previous tab,
while for `horizontal`, the `left` and `right` arrow keys moves focus between tabs.
```

```md alert warning
# When using vertical orientation, make sure to assign a tabs.content for each trigger.

Defining triggers without content will result in a visual bug where the width of the triggers list isn't constant.
```

```python demo
rx.tabs.root(
    rx.tabs.list(
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 1", value="tab1"),
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 2", value="tab2")
    ),
    rx.tabs.content(
        rx.text("item on tab 1"),
        value="tab1",
    ),
    rx.tabs.content(
        rx.text("item on tab 2"),
        value="tab2",
    ),
    default_value="tab1",
    orientation="vertical",
)
```

```python demo
rx.tabs.root(
    rx.tabs.list(
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 1", value="tab1"),
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 2", value="tab2")
    ),
    rx.tabs.content(
        rx.text("item on tab 1"),
        value="tab1",
    ),
    rx.tabs.content(
        rx.text("item on tab 2"),
        value="tab2",
    ),
    default_value="tab1",
    orientation="horizontal",
)
```

### Value

We use the `value` prop to specify the controlled value of the tab that we want to activate. This property should be used in conjunction with the `on_change` event argument.

```python demo exec
class TabsState(rx.State):
    """The app state."""

    value = "tab1"
    tab_selected = ""

    @rx.event
    def change_value(self, val):
        self.tab_selected = f"{val} clicked!"
        self.value = val


def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.container(
        rx.flex(
            rx.text(f"{TabsState.value}  clicked !"),
            rx.tabs.root(
                rx.tabs.list(
                    rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 1", value="tab1"),
                    rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 2", value="tab2"),
                ),
                rx.tabs.content(
                        rx.text("items on tab 1"),
                    value="tab1",
                ),
                rx.tabs.content(
                    rx.text("items on tab 2"),
                    value="tab2",
                ),
                default_value="tab1",
                value=TabsState.value,
                on_change=lambda x: TabsState.change_value(x),
            ),
            direction="column",
            spacing="2",
        ),
        padding="2em",
        font_size="2em",
        text_align="center",
    )
```

## Tablist

The Tablist is used to list the respective tabs to the tab component

## Tab Trigger

This is the button that activates the tab's associated content. It is typically used in the `Tablist`

## Styling

### Value

We use the `value` prop to assign a unique value that associates the trigger with content.

```python demo
rx.tabs.root(
    rx.tabs.list(
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 1", value="tab1"),
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 2", value="tab2"),
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 3", value="tab3")
    ),
)
```

### Disable

We use the `disabled` prop to disable the tab.

```python demo
rx.tabs.root(
    rx.tabs.list(
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 1", value="tab1"),
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 2", value="tab2"),
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 3", value="tab3", disabled=True)
    ),
)
```

## Tabs Content

Contains the content associated with each trigger.

## Styling

### Value

We use the `value` prop to assign a unique value that associates the content with a trigger.

```python
rx.tabs.root(
    rx.tabs.list(
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 1", value="tab1"),
        rx.tabs.trigger("Tab 2", value="tab2")
    ),
    rx.tabs.content(
        rx.text("item on tab 1"),
        value="tab1",
    ),
    rx.tabs.content(
        rx.text("item on tab 2"),
        value="tab2",
    ),
    default_value="tab1",
    orientation="vertical",
)
```

  - rx.switch

Switch: |
  lambda **props: rx.switch(**props)
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.templates.docpage import style_grid
from pcweb.pages.docs import vars
```

# Switch

A toggle switch alternative to the checkbox.

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example of a switch. We use the `on_change` trigger to toggle the value in the state.

```python demo exec
class SwitchState(rx.State):
    value: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def set_end(self, value: bool):
        self.value = value

def switch_intro():
    return rx.center(
        rx.switch(on_change=SwitchState.set_end),
        rx.badge(SwitchState.value),
    )
```

## Control the value

The `checked` prop is used to control the state of the switch. The event `on_change` is called when the state of the switch changes, when the `change_checked` event handler is called.

The `disabled` prop when `True`, prevents the user from interacting with the switch. In our example below, even though the second switch is `disabled` we are still able to change whether it is checked or not using the `checked` prop.

```python demo exec
class ControlSwitchState(rx.State):

    checked = True

    @rx.event
    def change_checked(self, checked: bool):
        """Change the switch checked var."""
        self.checked = checked


def control_switch_example():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.switch(
            checked=ControlSwitchState.checked,
            on_change=ControlSwitchState.change_checked,
        ),
        rx.switch(
            checked=ControlSwitchState.checked,
            on_change=ControlSwitchState.change_checked,
            disabled=True,
        ),
    )
```

## Switch in forms

The `name` of the switch is needed to submit with its owning form as part of a name/value pair. When the `required` prop is `True`, it indicates that the user must check the switch before the owning form can be submitted.

The `value` prop is only used for form submission, use the `checked` prop to control state of the `switch`.

```python demo exec
class FormSwitchState(rx.State):
    form_data: dict = {}

    @rx.event
    def handle_submit(self, form_data: dict):
        """Handle the form submit."""
        self.form_data = form_data


def switch_form_example():
    return rx.card(
            rx.vstack(
                rx.heading("Example Form"),
                rx.form.root(
                    rx.hstack(
                        rx.switch(name="switch"),
                        rx.button("Submit", type="submit"),
                        width="100%",
                    ),
                    on_submit=FormSwitchState.handle_submit,
                    reset_on_submit=True,
                ),
                rx.divider(),
                rx.hstack(
                    rx.heading("Results:"),
                    rx.badge(FormSwitchState.form_data.to_string()),
                ),
                align_items="left",
                width="100%",
            ),
        width="50%",
    )

# File Upload

Reflex makes it simple to add file upload functionality to your app. You can let users select files, store them on your server, and display or process them as needed. Below is a minimal example that demonstrates how to upload files, save them to disk, and display uploaded images using application state.


## Basic File Upload Example

You can let users upload files and keep track of them in your app’s state. The example below allows users to upload files, saves them using the backend, and then displays the uploaded files as images.

```python
import reflex as rx
class State(rx.State):
    uploaded_files: list[str] = []

    @rx.event
    async def handle_upload(self, files: list[rx.UploadFile]):
        for file in files:
            data = await file.read()
            path = rx.get_upload_dir() / file.name
            with path.open("wb") as f:
                f.write(data)
            self.uploaded_files.append(file.name)

def upload_component():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.upload(id="upload"),
        rx.button("Upload", on_click=State.handle_upload(rx.upload_files("upload"))),
        rx.foreach(State.uploaded_files, lambda f: rx.image(src=rx.get_upload_url(f))),
    )
```

## How File Upload Works

Selecting a file will add it to the browser file list, which can be rendered
on the frontend using the `rx.selected_files(id)` special Var. To clear the
selected files, you can use another special Var `rx.clear_selected_files(id)` as
an event handler.

To upload the file(s), you need to bind an event handler and pass the special
`rx.upload_files(upload_id=id)` event arg to it.

## File Storage Functions

Reflex provides two key functions for handling uploaded files:

### rx.get_upload_dir()
- **Purpose**: Returns a `Path` object pointing to the server-side directory where uploaded files should be saved
- **Usage**: Used in backend event handlers to determine where to save uploaded files
- **Default Location**: `./uploaded_files` (can be customized via `REFLEX_UPLOADED_FILES_DIR` environment variable)
- **Type**: Returns `pathlib.Path`

### rx.get_upload_url(filename)
- **Purpose**: Returns the URL string that can be used in frontend components to access uploaded files
- **Usage**: Used in frontend components (like `rx.image`, `rx.video`) to display uploaded files
- **URL Format**: `/_upload/filename`
- **Type**: Returns `str`

### Key Differences
- **rx.get_upload_dir()** -> Backend file path for saving files
- **rx.get_upload_url()** -> Frontend URL for displaying files

### Basic Upload Pattern

Here is the standard pattern for handling file uploads:

```python
import reflex as rx

def create_unique_filename(file_name: str):
    import random
    import string

    filename = "".join(random.choices(string.ascii_letters + string.digits, k=10))
    return filename + "_" + file_name

class State(rx.State):
    uploaded_files: list[str] = []

    @rx.event
    async def handle_upload(self, files: list[rx.UploadFile]):
        """Handle file upload with proper directory management."""
        for file in files:
            # Read the file data
            upload_data = await file.read()

            # Get the upload directory (backend path)
            upload_dir = rx.get_upload_dir()

            # Ensure the directory exists
            upload_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

            # Create unique filename to prevent conflicts
            unique_filename = create_unique_filename(file.name)

            # Create full file path
            file_path = upload_dir / unique_filename

            # Save the file
            with file_path.open("wb") as f:
                f.write(upload_data)

            # Store filename for frontend display
            self.uploaded_files.append(unique_filename)

def upload_component():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.upload(
            rx.text("Drop files here or click to select"),
            id="file_upload",
            border="2px dashed #ccc",
            padding="2em",
        ),
        rx.button(
            "Upload Files",
            on_click=State.handle_upload(rx.upload_files(upload_id="file_upload")),
        ),
        # Display uploaded files using rx.get_upload_url()
        rx.foreach(
            State.uploaded_files,
            lambda filename: rx.image(src=rx.get_upload_url(filename))
        ),
    )

```

### Multiple File Upload

Below is an example of how to allow multiple file uploads (in this case images).

```python demo box
rx.image(src="/upload.gif")
```

```python
class State(rx.State):
    """The app state."""

    # The images to show.
    img: list[str]

    @rx.event
    async def handle_upload(self, files: list[rx.UploadFile]):
        """Handle the upload of file(s).

        Args:
            files: The uploaded files.
        """
        for file in files:
            upload_data = await file.read()
            outfile = rx.get_upload_dir() / file.name

            # Save the file.
            with outfile.open("wb") as file_object:
                file_object.write(upload_data)

            # Update the img var.
            self.img.append(file.name)


color = "rgb(107,99,246)"


def index():
    """The main view."""
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.upload(
            rx.vstack(
                rx.button("Select File", color=color, bg="white", border=f"1px solid {color}"),
                rx.text("Drag and drop files here or click to select files"),
            ),
            id="upload1",
            border=f"1px dotted {color}",
            padding="5em",
        ),
        rx.hstack(rx.foreach(rx.selected_files("upload1"), rx.text)),
        rx.button(
            "Upload",
            on_click=State.handle_upload(rx.upload_files(upload_id="upload1")),
        ),
        rx.button(
            "Clear",
            on_click=rx.clear_selected_files("upload1"),
        ),
        rx.foreach(State.img, lambda img: rx.image(src=rx.get_upload_url(img))),
        padding="5em",
    )
```

### Uploading a Single File (Video)

Below is an example of how to allow only a single file upload and render (in this case a video).

```python demo box
rx.el.video(src="/upload_single_video.webm", auto_play=True, controls=True, loop=True)
```

```python
class State(rx.State):
    """The app state."""

    # The video to show.
    video: str

    @rx.event
    async def handle_upload(
        self, files: list[rx.UploadFile]
    ):
        """Handle the upload of file(s).

        Args:
            files: The uploaded files.
        """
        current_file = files[0]
        upload_data = await current_file.read()
        outfile = rx.get_upload_dir() / current_file.name

        # Save the file.
        with outfile.open("wb") as file_object:
            file_object.write(upload_data)

        # Update the video var.
        self.video = current_file.name


color = "rgb(107,99,246)"


def index():
    """The main view."""
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.upload(
            rx.vstack(
                rx.button(
                    "Select File",
                    color=color,
                    bg="white",
                    border=f"1px solid \{color}",
                ),
                rx.text(
                    "Drag and drop files here or click to select files"
                ),
            ),
            id="upload1",
            max_files=1,
            border=f"1px dotted {color}",
            padding="5em",
        ),
        rx.text(rx.selected_files("upload1")),
        rx.button(
            "Upload",
            on_click=State.handle_upload(
                rx.upload_files(upload_id="upload1")
            ),
        ),
        rx.button(
            "Clear",
            on_click=rx.clear_selected_files("upload1"),
        ),
        rx.cond(
            State.video,
            rx.video(src=rx.get_upload_url(State.video)),
        ),
        padding="5em",
    )
```


### Customizing the Upload

In the example below, the upload component accepts a maximum number of 5 files of specific types.
It also disables the use of the space or enter key in uploading files.

To use a one-step upload, bind the event handler to the `rx.upload` component's
`on_drop` trigger.

```python
class State(rx.State):
    """The app state."""

    # The images to show.
    img: list[str]

    async def handle_upload(self, files: list[rx.UploadFile]):
        """Handle the upload of file(s).

        Args:
            files: The uploaded files.
        """
        for file in files:
            upload_data = await file.read()
            outfile = rx.get_upload_dir() / file.name

            # Save the file.
            with outfile.open("wb") as file_object:
                file_object.write(upload_data)

            # Update the img var.
            self.img.append(file.name)


color = "rgb(107,99,246)"


def index():
    """The main view."""
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.upload(
            rx.vstack(
                rx.button("Select File", color=color, bg="white", border=f"1px solid {color}"),
                rx.text("Drag and drop files here or click to select files"),
            ),
            id="upload2",
            multiple=True,
            accept = {
                "application/pdf": [".pdf"],
                "image/png": [".png"],
                "image/jpeg": [".jpg", ".jpeg"],
                "image/gif": [".gif"],
                "image/webp": [".webp"],
                "text/html": [".html", ".htm"],
            },
            max_files=5,
            disabled=False,
            no_keyboard=True,
            on_drop=State.handle_upload(rx.upload_files(upload_id="upload2")),
            border=f"1px dotted {color}",
            padding="5em",
        ),
        rx.grid(
            rx.foreach(
                State.img,
                lambda img: rx.vstack(
                    rx.image(src=rx.get_upload_url(img)),
                    rx.text(img),
                ),
            ),
            columns="2",
            spacing="1",
        ),
        padding="5em",
    )
```

### Unstyled Upload Component

To use a completely unstyled upload component and apply your own customization, use `rx.upload.root` instead:

```python demo
rx.upload.root(
    rx.box(
        rx.icon(
            tag="cloud_upload",
            style={"width": "3rem", "height": "3rem", "color": "#2563eb", "marginBottom": "0.75rem"},
        ),
        rx.hstack(
            rx.text(
                "Click to upload",
                style={"fontWeight": "bold", "color": "#1d4ed8"},
            ),
            " or drag and drop",
            style={"fontSize": "0.875rem", "color": "#4b5563"},
        ),
        rx.text(
            "SVG, PNG, JPG or GIF (MAX. 5MB)",
            style={"fontSize": "0.75rem", "color": "#6b7280", "marginTop": "0.25rem"},
        ),
        style={
            "display": "flex",
            "flexDirection": "column",
            "alignItems": "center",
            "justifyContent": "center",
            "padding": "1.5rem",
            "textAlign": "center",
        },
    ),
    id="my_upload",
    style={
        "maxWidth": "24rem",
        "height": "16rem",
        "borderWidth": "2px",
        "borderStyle": "dashed",
        "borderColor": "#60a5fa",
        "borderRadius": "0.75rem",
        "cursor": "pointer",
        "transitionProperty": "background-color",
        "transitionDuration": "0.2s",
        "transitionTimingFunction": "ease-in-out",
        "display": "flex",
        "alignItems": "center",
        "justifyContent": "center",
        "boxShadow": "0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)",
    },
)
```

## Handling the Upload

Your event handler should be an async function that accepts a single argument,
`files: list[UploadFile]`, which will contain [FastAPI UploadFile](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/request-files) instances.
You can read the files and save them anywhere as shown in the example.

In your UI, you can bind the event handler to a trigger, such as a button
`on_click` event or upload `on_drop` event, and pass in the files using
`rx.upload_files()`.

### Saving the File

By convention, Reflex provides the function `rx.get_upload_dir()` to get the directory where uploaded files may be saved. The upload dir comes from the environment variable `REFLEX_UPLOADED_FILES_DIR`, or `./uploaded_files` if not specified.

The backend of your app will mount this uploaded files directory on `/_upload` without restriction. Any files uploaded via this mechanism will automatically be publicly accessible. To get the URL for a file inside the upload dir, use the `rx.get_upload_url(filename)` function in a frontend component.

```md alert info
# When using the Reflex hosting service, the uploaded files directory is not persistent and will be cleared on every deployment. For persistent storage of uploaded files, it is recommended to use an external service, such as S3.
```

### Directory Structure and URLs

By default, Reflex creates the following structure:

```text
your_project/
├── uploaded_files/          # rx.get_upload_dir() points here
│   ├── image1.png
│   ├── document.pdf
│   └── video.mp4
└── ...
```

The files are automatically served at:
- `/_upload/image1.png` ← `rx.get_upload_url("image1.png")`
- `/_upload/document.pdf` ← `rx.get_upload_url("document.pdf")`
- `/_upload/video.mp4` ← `rx.get_upload_url("video.mp4")`

## Cancellation

The `id` provided to the `rx.upload` component can be passed to the special event handler `rx.cancel_upload(id)` to stop uploading on demand. Cancellation can be triggered directly by a frontend event trigger, or it can be returned from a backend event handler.

## Progress

The `rx.upload_files` special event arg also accepts an `on_upload_progress` event trigger which will be fired about every second during the upload operation to report the progress of the upload. This can be used to update a progress bar or other UI elements to show the user the progress of the upload.

```python
class UploadExample(rx.State):
    uploading: bool = False
    progress: int = 0
    total_bytes: int = 0

    @rx.event
    async def handle_upload(self, files: list[rx.UploadFile]):
        for file in files:
            self.total_bytes += len(await file.read())

    @rx.event
    def handle_upload_progress(self, progress: dict):
        self.uploading = True
        self.progress = round(progress["progress"] * 100)
        if self.progress >= 100:
            self.uploading = False

    @rx.event
    def cancel_upload(self):
        self.uploading = False
        return rx.cancel_upload("upload3")


def upload_form():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.upload(
            rx.text("Drag and drop files here or click to select files"),
            id="upload3",
            border="1px dotted rgb(107,99,246)",
            padding="5em",
        ),
        rx.vstack(rx.foreach(rx.selected_files("upload3"), rx.text)),
        rx.progress(value=UploadExample.progress, max=100),
        rx.cond(
            ~UploadExample.uploading,
            rx.button(
                "Upload",
                on_click=UploadExample.handle_upload(
                    rx.upload_files(
                        upload_id="upload3",
                        on_upload_progress=UploadExample.handle_upload_progress,
                    ),
                ),
            ),
            rx.button("Cancel", on_click=UploadExample.cancel_upload),
        ),
        rx.text("Total bytes uploaded: ", UploadExample.total_bytes),
        align="center",
    )
```

The `progress` dictionary contains the following keys:

```javascript
\{
    'loaded': 36044800,
    'total': 54361908,
    'progress': 0.6630525183185255,
    'bytes': 20447232,
    'rate': None,
    'estimated': None,
    'event': \{'isTrusted': True},
    'upload': True
}
```

# Form

Forms are used to collect user input. The `rx.form` component is used to group inputs and submit them together.

The form component's children can be form controls such as `rx.input`, `rx.checkbox`, `rx.slider`, `rx.textarea`, `rx.radio_group`, `rx.select` or `rx.switch`. The controls should have a `name` attribute that is used to identify the control in the form data. The `on_submit` event trigger submits the form data as a dictionary to the `handle_submit` event handler.

The form is submitted when the user clicks the submit button or presses enter on the form controls.

```python demo exec
class FormState(rx.State):
    form_data: dict = {}

    @rx.event
    def handle_submit(self, form_data: dict):
        """Handle the form submit."""
        self.form_data = form_data


def form_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.form(
            rx.vstack(
                rx.input(placeholder="First Name", name="first_name"),
                rx.input(placeholder="Last Name", name="last_name"),
                rx.hstack(
                    rx.checkbox("Checked", name="check"),
                    rx.switch("Switched", name="switch"),
                ),
                rx.button("Submit", type="submit"),
            ),
            on_submit=FormState.handle_submit,
            reset_on_submit=True,
        ),
        rx.divider(),
        rx.heading("Results"),
        rx.text(FormState.form_data.to_string()),
    )
```

```md alert warning
# When using the form you must include a button or input with `type='submit'`.
```

```md alert info
# Using `name` vs `id`.

When using the `name` attribute in form controls like `rx.switch`, `rx.radio_group`, and `rx.checkbox`, these controls will only be included in the form data if their values are set (e.g., if the checkbox is checked, the switch is toggled, or a radio option is selected).

If you need these controls to be passed in the form data even when their values are not set, you can use the `id` attribute instead of name. The id attribute ensures that the control is always included in the submitted form data, regardless of whether its value is set or not.

## Dynamic Forms

Forms can be dynamically created by iterating through state vars using `rx.foreach`.

This example allows the user to add new fields to the form prior to submit, and all
fields will be included in the form data passed to the `handle_submit` function.

```python demo exec
class DynamicFormState(rx.State):
    form_data: dict = {}
    form_fields: list[str] = ["first_name", "last_name", "email"]

    @rx.var(cache=True)
    def form_field_placeholders(self) -> list[str]:
        return [
            " ".join(w.capitalize() for w in field.split("_"))
            for field in self.form_fields
        ]

    @rx.event
    def add_field(self, form_data: dict):
        new_field = form_data.get("new_field")
        if not new_field:
            return
        field_name = new_field.strip().lower().replace(" ", "_")
        self.form_fields.append(field_name)

    @rx.event
    def handle_submit(self, form_data: dict):
        self.form_data = form_data


def dynamic_form():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.form(
            rx.vstack(
                rx.foreach(
                    DynamicFormState.form_fields,
                    lambda field, idx: rx.input(
                        placeholder=DynamicFormState.form_field_placeholders[idx],
                        name=field,
                    ),
                ),
                rx.button("Submit", type="submit"),
            ),
            on_submit=DynamicFormState.handle_submit,
            reset_on_submit=True,
        ),
        rx.form(
            rx.hstack(
                rx.input(placeholder="New Field", name="new_field"),
                rx.button("+", type="submit"),
            ),
            on_submit=DynamicFormState.add_field,
            reset_on_submit=True,
        ),
        rx.divider(),
        rx.heading("Results"),
        rx.text(DynamicFormState.form_data.to_string()),
    )
```

# Select

Displays a list of options for the user to pick from—triggered by a button.

```python demo exec
class SelectState(rx.State):
    value: str = "apple"

    @rx.event
    def change_value(self, value: str):
        """Change the select value var."""
        self.value = value


def select_intro():
    return rx.center(
        rx.select(
            ["apple", "grape", "pear"],
            value=SelectState.value,
            on_change=SelectState.change_value,
        ),
        rx.badge(SelectState.value),
    )
```

```python demo exec
class SelectState3(rx.State):

    values: list[str] = ["apple", "grape", "pear"]

    value: str = "apple"

    def set_value(self, value: str):
        self.value = value

    @rx.event
    def change_value(self):
        """Change the select value var."""
        self.value = random.choice(self.values)


def select_example3():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.select(
            SelectState3.values,
            value=SelectState3.value,
            on_change=SelectState3.set_value,
        ),
        rx.button("Change Value", on_click=SelectState3.change_value),

    )
```

The `on_open_change` event handler acts in a similar way to the `on_change` and is called when the open state of the select changes.

```python demo
rx.select(
    ["apple", "grape", "pear"],
    on_change=rx.window_alert("on_change event handler called"),
)

```

### Submitting a form using select

The `name` prop is needed to submit with its owning form as part of a name/value pair.

When the `required` prop is `True`, it indicates that the user must select a value before the owning form can be submitted.

```python demo exec
class FormSelectState(rx.State):
    form_data: dict = {}

    @rx.event
    def handle_submit(self, form_data: dict):
        """Handle the form submit."""
        self.form_data = form_data


def select_form_example():
    return rx.card(
        rx.vstack(
            rx.heading("Example Form"),
            rx.form.root(
                rx.flex(
                    rx.select(["apple", "grape", "pear"], default_value="apple", name="select", required=True),
                    rx.button("Submit", flex="1", type="submit"),
                    width="100%",
                    spacing="3",
                ),
                on_submit=FormSelectState.handle_submit,
                reset_on_submit=True,
            ),
            rx.divider(),
            rx.hstack(
                rx.heading("Results:"),
                rx.badge(FormSelectState.form_data.to_string()),
            ),
            align_items="left",
            width="100%",
        ),
        width="50%",
    )
```


### Using Select within a Drawer component

If using within a [Drawer](/docs/library/overlay/drawer) component, set the `position` prop to `"popper"` to ensure the select menu is displayed correctly.

```python demo
rx.drawer.root(
    rx.drawer.trigger(rx.button("Open Drawer")),
    rx.drawer.overlay(z_index="5"),
    rx.drawer.portal(
        rx.drawer.content(
            rx.vstack(
                rx.drawer.close(rx.box(rx.button("Close"))),
                rx.select(["apple", "grape", "pear"], position="popper"),
            ),
            width="20em",
            padding="2em",
            background_color=rx.color("gray", 1),
        ),
    ),
    direction="left",
)
```

# Select

Displays a list of options for the user to pick from, triggered by a button.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.select.root(
    rx.select.trigger(),
    rx.select.content(
        rx.select.group(
            rx.select.label("Fruits"),
            rx.select.item("Orange", value="orange"),
            rx.select.item("Apple", value="apple"),
            rx.select.item("Grape", value="grape", disabled=True),
        ),
        rx.select.separator(),
        rx.select.group(
            rx.select.label("Vegetables"),
            rx.select.item("Carrot", value="carrot"),
            rx.select.item("Potato", value="potato"),
        ),
    ),
    default_value="apple",
)
```

## Usage

## Disabling

It is possible to disable individual items in a `select` using the `disabled` prop associated with the `rx.select.item`.

```python demo
rx.select.root(
    rx.select.trigger(placeholder="Select a Fruit"),
    rx.select.content(
        rx.select.group(
            rx.select.item("Apple", value="apple"),
            rx.select.item("Grape", value="grape", disabled=True),
            rx.select.item("Pineapple", value="pineapple"),
        ),
    ),
)
```

To prevent the user from interacting with select entirely, set the `disabled` prop to `True` on the `rx.select.root` component.

```python demo
rx.select.root(
    rx.select.trigger(placeholder="This is Disabled"),
    rx.select.content(
        rx.select.group(
            rx.select.item("Apple", value="apple"),
            rx.select.item("Grape", value="grape"),
        ),
    ),
    disabled=True,
)
```

## Setting Defaults

It is possible to set several default values when constructing a `select`.

The `placeholder` prop in the `rx.select.trigger` specifies the content that will be rendered when `value` or `default_value` is empty or not set.

```python demo
rx.select.root(
    rx.select.trigger(placeholder="pick a fruit"),
    rx.select.content(
        rx.select.group(
            rx.select.item("Apple", value="apple"),
            rx.select.item("Grape", value="grape"),
        ),
    ),
)
```

The `default_value` in the `rx.select.root` specifies the value of the `select` when initially rendered.
The `default_value` should correspond to the `value` of a child `rx.select.item`.

```python demo
rx.select.root(
    rx.select.trigger(),
    rx.select.content(
        rx.select.group(
            rx.select.item("Apple", value="apple"),
            rx.select.item("Grape", value="grape"),
        ),
    ),
    default_value="apple",
)
```

## Fully controlled

The `on_change` event trigger is fired when the value of the select changes.
In this example the `rx.select_root` `value` prop specifies which item is selected, and this
can also be controlled using state and a button without direct interaction with the select component.

```python demo exec
class SelectState2(rx.State):

    values: list[str] = ["apple", "grape", "pear"]

    value: str = ""

    def set_value(self, value: str):
        self.value = value

    @rx.event
    def choose_randomly(self):
        """Change the select value var."""
        original_value = self.value
        while self.value == original_value:
            self.value = random.choice(self.values)


def select_example2():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.select.root(
            rx.select.trigger(placeholder="No Selection"),
            rx.select.content(
                rx.select.group(
                    rx.foreach(SelectState2.values, lambda x: rx.select.item(x, value=x))
                ),
            ),
            value=SelectState2.value,
            on_change=SelectState2.set_value,

        ),
        rx.button("Choose Randomly", on_click=SelectState2.choose_randomly),
        rx.button("Reset", on_click=SelectState2.set_value("")),
    )
```

The `open` prop and `on_open_change` event trigger work similarly to `value` and `on_change` to control the open state of the select.
If `on_open_change` handler does not alter the `open` prop, the select will not be able to be opened or closed by clicking on the
`select_trigger`.

```python demo exec
class SelectState8(rx.State):
    is_open: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def set_is_open(self, value: bool):
        self.is_open = value

def select_example8():
    return rx.flex(
        rx.select.root(

### Submitting a Form with Select

When a select is part of a form, the `name` prop of the `rx.select.root` sets the key that will be submitted with the form data.

The `value` prop of `rx.select.item` provides the value to be associated with the `name` key when the form is submitted with that item selected.

When the `required` prop of the `rx.select.root` is `True`, it indicates that the user must select a value before the form may be submitted.

```python demo exec
class FormSelectState(rx.State):
    form_data: dict = {}

    @rx.event
    def handle_submit(self, form_data: dict):
        """Handle the form submit."""
        self.form_data = form_data


def form_select():
    return rx.flex(
        rx.form.root(
            rx.flex(
                rx.select.root(
                    rx.select.trigger(),
                    rx.select.content(
                        rx.select.group(
                            rx.select.label("Fruits"),
                            rx.select.item("Orange", value="orange"),
                            rx.select.item("Apple", value="apple"),
                            rx.select.item("Grape", value="grape"),
                        ),

                        rx.select.group(
                            rx.select.label("Vegetables"),
                            rx.select.item("Carrot", value="carrot"),
                            rx.select.item("Potato", value="potato"),
                        ),
                    ),
                    default_value="apple",
                    name="select",
                ),

            on_submit=FormSelectState.handle_submit,
            reset_on_submit=True,
        ),
        rx.divider(size="4"),
        rx.heading("Results"),
        rx.text(FormSelectState.form_data.to_string()),

# Input

The `input` component is an input field that users can type into.

```md video https://youtube.com/embed/ITOZkzjtjUA?start=1517&end=1869
# Video: Input
```

## Basic Example

The `on_blur` event handler is called when focus has left the `input` for example, it’s called when the user clicks outside of a focused text input.

```python demo exec
class TextfieldBlur(rx.State):
    text: str = "Hello World!"

    @rx.event
    def set_text(self, value: str):
        self.text = value

def blur_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(TextfieldBlur.text),
        rx.input(
            placeholder="Search here...",
            on_blur=TextfieldBlur.set_text,
        ),
    )
```

The `on_change` event handler is called when the `value` of `input` has changed.

```python demo exec
class TextfieldControlled(rx.State):
    text: str = "Hello World!"

    @rx.event
    def set_text(self, value: str):
        self.text = value

def controlled_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(TextfieldControlled.text),
        rx.input(
            placeholder="Search here...",
            value=TextfieldControlled.text,
            on_change=TextfieldControlled.set_text,
        ),
    )
```

Behind the scenes, the input component is implemented as a debounced input to avoid sending individual state updates per character to the backend while the user is still typing. This allows a state variable to directly control the `value` prop from the backend without the user experiencing input lag.

## Input Types

The `type` prop controls how the input is rendered (e.g. plain text, password, file picker).

It accepts the same values as the native HTML `<input type>` attribute, such as:

- `"text"` (default)
- `"password"`
- `"email"`
- `"number"`
- `"file"`
- `"checkbox"`
- `"radio"`
- `"date"`
- `"time"`
- `"url"`
- `"color"`

and several others. See the [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types) for the full list.

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.input(placeholder="Username", type="text"),
    rx.input(placeholder="Password", type="password"),
    rx.input(type="date"),
)
```

## Submitting a form using input

The `name` prop is needed to submit with its owning form as part of a name/value pair.

When the `required` prop is `True`, it indicates that the user must input text before the owning form can be submitted.

The `type` is set here to `password`. The element is presented as a one-line plain text editor control in which the text is obscured so that it cannot be read. The `type` prop can take any value of `email`, `file`, `password`, `text` and several others. Learn more [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input).

```python demo exec
class FormInputState(rx.State):
    form_data: dict = {}

    @rx.event
    def handle_submit(self, form_data: dict):
        """Handle the form submit."""
        self.form_data = form_data


def form_input1():
    return rx.card(
        rx.vstack(
            rx.heading("Example Form"),
            rx.form.root(
                rx.hstack(
                    rx.input(
                        name="input",
                        placeholder="Enter text...",
                        type="text",
                        required=True,
                    ),
                    rx.button("Submit", type="submit"),
                    width="100%",
                ),
                on_submit=FormInputState.handle_submit,
                reset_on_submit=True,
            ),
            rx.divider(),
            rx.hstack(
                rx.heading("Results:"),
                rx.badge(FormInputState.form_data.to_string()),
            ),
            align_items="left",
            width="100%",
        ),
        width="50%",
    )
```

## Setting a value without using a State var

Set the value of the specified reference element, without needing to link it up to a State var. This is an alternate way to modify the value of the `input`.

```python demo
rx.hstack(
    rx.input(id="input1"),
    rx.button("Erase", on_click=rx.set_value("input1", "")),
)
```

# Radio Group

A set of interactive radio buttons where only one can be selected at a time.

## Basic example

```python demo exec
class RadioGroupState(rx.State):
    item: str = "No Selection"

    @rx.event
    def set_item(self, item: str):
        self.item = item

def radio_group_state_example():

        rx.radio(["1", "2", "3"], on_change=RadioGroupState.set_item, direction="row"),
    )
```

## Submitting a form using Radio Group

The `name` prop is used to name the group. It is submitted with its owning form as part of a name/value pair.

When the `required` prop is `True`, it indicates that the user must check a radio item before the owning form can be submitted.

```python demo exec
class FormRadioState(rx.State):
    form_data: dict = {}

    @rx.event
    def handle_submit(self, form_data: dict):

            rx.form.root(
                rx.vstack(
                    rx.radio_group(
                        ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
                        name="radio_choice",
                        direction="row",
                    ),
                    rx.button("Submit", type="submit"),

                    spacing="4",
                ),
                on_submit=FormRadioState.handle_submit,
                reset_on_submit=True,
            ),
            rx.divider(),
            rx.hstack(

                rx.badge(FormRadioState.form_data.to_string()),
            ),

```

Forms are used to collect information from your users. Forms group the inputs and submit them together.

## Basic Example

Here is an example of a form collecting an email address, with built-in validation on the email. If email entered is invalid, the form cannot be submitted. Note that the `form.submit` button is not automatically disabled. It is still clickable, but does not submit the form data. After successful submission, an alert window shows up and the form is cleared. There are a few `flex` containers used in the example to control the layout of the form components.

```python demo
rx.form.root(
    rx.form.field(
        rx.flex(
            rx.form.label("Email"),
            rx.form.control(
                rx.input(
                    placeholder="Email Address",
                    # type attribute is required for "typeMismatch" validation
                    type="email",
                ),
                as_child=True,
            ),
            rx.form.message("Please enter a valid email", match="typeMismatch"),
            rx.form.submit(
                  rx.button("Submit"),
                  as_child=True,
            ),
            direction="column",
            spacing="2",
            align="stretch",
        ),
        name="email",
    ),
    on_submit=lambda form_data: rx.window_alert(form_data.to_string()),
    reset_on_submit=True,
)
```

In this example, the `rx.input` has an attribute `type="email"` and the `form.message` has the attribute `match="typeMismatch"`. Those are required for the form to validate the input by its type. The prop `as_child="True"` is required when using other components to construct a Form component. This example has used `rx.input` to construct the Form Control and `button` the Form Submit.

## Form Anatomy

```python eval
rx._x.code_block(
    """form.root(
    form.field(
        form.label(...),
        form.control(...),
        form.message(...),
    ),
    form.submit(...),
)""",
    language="python",
)
```

A Form Root (`form.root`) contains all the parts of a form. The Form Field (`form.field`), Form Submit (`form.submit`), etc should all be inside a Form Root. A Form Field can contain a Form Label (`form.label`), a Form Control (`form.control`), and a Form Message (`form.message`). A Form Label is a label element. A Form Control is where the user enters the input or makes selections. By default, the Form Control is a input. Using other form components to construct the Form Control is supported. To do that, set the prop `as_child=True` on the Form Control.

```md alert info
The current version of Radix Forms does not support composing **Form Control** with other Radix form primitives such as **Checkbox**, **Select**, etc.
```

The Form Message is a validation message which is automatically wired (functionality and accessibility). When the Form Control determines the input is invalid, the Form Message is shown. The `match` prop is to enable [client side validation](#client-side-validation). To perform [server side validation](#server-side-validation), **both** the `force_match` prop of the Form Control and the `server_invalid` prop of the Form Field are set together.

The Form Submit is by default a button that submits the form. To use another button component as a Form Submit, include that button as a child inside `form.submit` and set the prop `as_child=True`.

The `on_submit` prop of the Form Root accepts an event handler. It is called with the submitted form data dictionary. To clear the form after submission, set the `reset_on_submit=True` prop.

## Data Submission

As previously mentioned, the various pieces of data in the form are submitted together as a dictionary. The form control or the input components must have the `name` attribute. This `name` is the key to get the value from the form data dictionary. If no validation is needed, the form type components such as Checkbox, Radio Groups, TextArea can be included directly under the Form Root instead of inside a Form Control.

## Validation

Server side validation is done through **Computed Vars** on the State. The **Var** should return a boolean flag indicating when input is invalid. Set that **Var** on both the `server_invalid` prop of `form.field` and the `force_match` prop of `form.message`. There is an example how to do that in the [Final Example](#final-example).

## Final Example

The final example shows a form that collects username and email during sign-up and validates them using server side validation. When server side validation fails, messages are displayed in red to show what is not accepted in the form, and the submit button is disabled. After submission, the collected form data is displayed in texts below the form and the form is cleared.

    # These track the user input real time for validation

# Checkbox

## Basic Example

The `on_change` trigger is called when the `checkbox` is clicked.

```python demo exec
class CheckboxState(rx.State):
    checked: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def set_checked(self, value: bool):
        self.checked = value

def checkbox_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(CheckboxState.checked),
        rx.checkbox(on_change=CheckboxState.set_checked),
    )
```

The `input` prop is used to set the `checkbox` as a controlled component.

```python demo exec
class FormCheckboxState(rx.State):
    form_data: dict = {}

    @rx.event
    def handle_submit(self, form_data: dict):
        """Handle the form submit."""
        print(form_data)
        self.form_data = form_data


def form_checkbox_example():
    return rx.card(
        rx.vstack(
            rx.heading("Example Form"),
            rx.form.root(
                rx.hstack(
                    rx.checkbox(
                        name="checkbox",
                        label="Accept terms and conditions",
                    ),
                    rx.button("Submit", type="submit"),
                    width="100%",
                ),
                on_submit=FormCheckboxState.handle_submit,
                reset_on_submit=True,
            ),
            rx.divider(),
            rx.hstack(
                rx.heading("Results:"),
                rx.badge(FormCheckboxState.form_data.to_string()),
            ),

# Button

Buttons are essential elements in your application's user interface that users can click to trigger events.

## Basic Example

The `on_click` trigger is called when the button is clicked.

```python demo exec
class CountState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0

    @rx.event
    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1

    @rx.event
    def decrement(self):
        self.count -= 1

def counter():
    return rx.flex(
        rx.button(
            "Decrement",
            color_scheme="red",
            on_click=CountState.decrement,
        ),
        rx.heading(CountState.count),
        rx.button(
            "Increment",
            color_scheme="grass",
            on_click=CountState.increment,
        ),
        spacing="3",
    )
```

### Loading and Disabled

The `loading` prop is used to indicate that the action triggered by the button is currently in progress. When set to `True`, the button displays a loading spinner, providing visual feedback to the user that the action is being processed. This also prevents multiple clicks while the button is in the loading state. By default, `loading` is set to `False`.

The `disabled` prop also prevents the button from being but does not provide a spinner.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.button("Regular"),
    rx.button("Loading", loading=True),
    rx.button("Disabled", disabled=True),
    spacing="2",
)
```

  lambda **props: rx.text_area(**props)
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Text Area

A text area is a multi-line text input field.

## Basic Example

The text area component can be controlled by a single value. The `on_blur` prop can be used to update the value when the text area loses focus.

```python demo exec
class TextAreaBlur(rx.State):
    text: str = "Hello World!"

    @rx.event
    def set_text(self, text: str):
        self.text = text

def blur_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(TextAreaBlur.text),
        rx.text_area(
            placeholder="Type here...",
            on_blur=TextAreaBlur.set_text,
        ),
    )
```

## Text Area in forms

Here we show how to use a text area in a form. We use the `name` prop to identify the text area in the form data. The form data is then passed to the `submit_feedback` method to be processed.

```python demo exec
class TextAreaFeedbackState(rx.State):
    feedback: str = ""
    submitted: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def set_feedback(self, value: str):
        self.feedback = value

    @rx.event
    def submit_feedback(self, form_data: dict):
        self.submitted = True

    @rx.event
    def reset_form(self):
        self.feedback = ""
        self.submitted = False

def feedback_form():
    return rx.cond(
        TextAreaFeedbackState.submitted,
        rx.card(
            rx.vstack(
                rx.text("Thank you for your feedback!"),
                rx.button("Submit another response", on_click=TextAreaFeedbackState.reset_form),
            ),
        ),
        rx.card(
            rx.form(
                rx.flex(
                    rx.text("Are you enjoying Reflex?"),
                    rx.text_area(
                        placeholder="Write your feedback…",
                        value=TextAreaFeedbackState.feedback,
                        on_change=TextAreaFeedbackState.set_feedback,
                        resize="vertical",
                    ),
                    rx.button("Send", type="submit"),
                    direction="column",
                    spacing="3",
                ),
                on_submit=TextAreaFeedbackState.submit_feedback,
            ),
        ),
    )

# Input

A text field is an input field that users can type into. This component uses Radix's [text field](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/text-field) component.


## Overview

The TextField component is used to capture user input and can include an optional slot for buttons and icons. It is based on the <div> element and supports common margin props.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.input(
    rx.input.slot(
        rx.icon(tag="search"),

    ),
    placeholder="Search here...",
)
```

## Stateful Example with Blur Event

```python demo exec
class TextfieldBlur1(rx.State):
    text: str = "Hello World!"

    @rx.event
    def set_text(self, text: str):
        self.text = text

def blur_example1():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(TextfieldBlur1.text),
        rx.input(
            rx.input.slot(
                rx.icon(tag="search"),
            ),
            placeholder="Search here...",
            on_blur=TextfieldBlur1.set_text,
        )
    )
```

## Controlled Example

```python demo exec
class TextfieldControlled1(rx.State):
    text: str = "Hello World!"

    @rx.event
    def set_text(self, text: str):
        self.text = text

def controlled_example1():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(TextfieldControlled1.text),
        rx.input(
            rx.input.slot(
                rx.icon(tag="search"),
            ),
            placeholder="Search here...",
            value=TextfieldControlled1.text,
            on_change=TextfieldControlled1.set_text,
        ),
    )
```

# Slider

Provides user selection from a range of values. The

## Basic Example

The slider can be controlled by a single value or a range of values. Slider can be hooked to state to control its value. Passing a list of two values creates a range slider.

```python demo exec
class SliderState(rx.State):
    value: int = 50

    @rx.event
    def set_end(self, value: list[int | float]):
        self.value = value[0]

def slider_intro():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(SliderState.value),
        rx.slider(on_value_commit=SliderState.set_end),
        width="100%",
    )
```

## Range Slider

Range slider is created by passing a list of two values to the `default_value` prop. The list should contain two values that are in the range of the slider.

```python demo exec
class RangeSliderState(rx.State):
    value_start: int = 25
    value_end: int = 75

    @rx.event
    def set_end(self, value: list[int | float]):
        self.value_start = value[0]
        self.value_end = value[1]

def range_slider_intro():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.hstack(
            rx.heading(RangeSliderState.value_start),
            rx.heading(RangeSliderState.value_end),
        ),
        rx.slider(
            default_value=[25, 75],
            min_=0,
            max=100,
            size="1",
            on_value_commit=RangeSliderState.set_end,
        ),
        width="100%",
    )
```

## Live Updating Slider

You can use the `on_change` prop to update the slider value as you interact with it. The `on_change` prop takes a function that will be called with the new value of the slider.

Here we use the `throttle` method to limit the rate at which the function is called, which is useful to prevent excessive updates. In this example, the slider value is updated every 100ms.

```python demo exec
class LiveSliderState(rx.State):
    value: int = 50

    @rx.event
    def set_end(self, value: list[int | float]):
        self.value = value[0]

def live_slider_intro():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(LiveSliderState.value),
        rx.slider(
            default_value=50,
            min_=0,
            max=100,
            on_change=LiveSliderState.set_end.throttle(100),
        ),
        width="100%",
    )
```

## Slider in forms

Here we show how to use a slider in a form. We use the `name` prop to identify the slider in the form data. The form data is then passed to the `handle_submit` method to be processed.

```python demo exec
class FormSliderState(rx.State):
    form_data: dict = {}

    @rx.event
    def handle_submit(self, form_data: dict):
        """Handle the form submit."""
        self.form_data = form_data


def slider_form_example():
    return rx.card(
            rx.vstack(
                rx.heading("Example Form"),
                rx.form.root(
                    rx.hstack(
                        rx.slider(default_value=40, name="slider"),
                        rx.button("Submit", type="submit"),
                        width="100%",
                    ),
                    on_submit=FormSliderState.handle_submit,
                    reset_on_submit=True,
                ),
                rx.divider(),
                rx.hstack(
                    rx.heading("Results:"),
                    rx.badge(FormSliderState.form_data.to_string()),
                ),
                align_items="left",
                width="100%",
            ),
        width="50%",
    )
```

```

The video component can display a video given an src path as an argument. This could either be a local path from the assets folder or an external link.

```python demo
rx.video(
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bZkp7q19f0",
    width="400px",
    height="auto"
)
```

If we had a local file in the `assets` folder named `test.mp4` we could set `url="/test.mp4"` to view the video.

# Image

The Image component can display an image given a `src` path as an argument.
This could either be a local path from the assets folder or an external link.

```python demo
rx.image(src="/logo.jpg", width="100px", height="auto")
```

Image composes a box and can be styled similarly.

```python demo
rx.image(
    src="/logo.jpg",
    width="100px",
    height="auto",
    border_radius="15px 50px",
    border="5px solid #555",
)
```

You can also pass a `PIL` image object as the `src`.

```python demo box
rx.image(src="https://picsum.photos/id/1/200/300", alt="An Unsplash Image")
```

```python
from PIL import Image
import requests


class ImageState(rx.State):
    url: str = f"https://picsum.photos/id/1/200/300"
    image: Image.Image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

    return rx.vstack(
        rx.image(src=ImageState.image)
    )
```

```md alert info
# rx.image only accepts URLs and Pillow Images

components:
    - rx.moment

# Moment

Displaying date and relative time to now sometimes can be more complicated than necessary.

To make it easy, Reflex is wrapping [react-moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-moment)  under `rx.moment`.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex.utils.serializers import serialize_datetime
from pcweb.templates.docpage import docdemo, docdemobox, doccode, docgraphing
```

## Examples

Using a date from a state var as a value, we will display it in a few different
way using `rx.moment`.

The `date_now` state var is initialized when the site was deployed. The
button below can be used to update the var to the current datetime, which will
be reflected in the subsequent examples.

```python demo exec
from datetime import datetime, timezone

class MomentState(rx.State):
    date_now: datetime = datetime.now(timezone.utc)

    @rx.event
    def update(self):
        self.date_now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)


def moment_update_example():
    return rx.button("Update", rx.moment(MomentState.date_now), on_click=MomentState.update)
```

### Display the date as-is:

```python demo
rx.moment(MomentState.date_now)
```

### Humanized interval

Sometimes we don't want to display just a raw date, but we want something more instinctive to read. That's when we can use `from_now` and `to_now`.

```python demo
rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, from_now=True)
```

```python demo
rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, to_now=True)
```
You can also set a duration (in milliseconds) with `from_now_during` where the date will display as relative, then after that, it will be displayed as defined in `format`.

```python demo
rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, from_now_during=100000)  # after 100 seconds, date will display normally
```

### Formatting dates

```python demo
rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, format="YYYY-MM-DD")
```

```python demo
rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, format="HH:mm:ss")
```

### Offset Date

With the props `add` and `subtract`, you can pass an `rx.MomentDelta` object to modify the displayed date without affecting the stored date in your state.

```python exec
add_example = """rx.vstack(
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, add=rx.MomentDelta(years=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, add=rx.MomentDelta(quarters=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, add=rx.MomentDelta(months=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, add=rx.MomentDelta(months=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, add=rx.MomentDelta(months=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, add=rx.MomentDelta(weeks=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, add=rx.MomentDelta(days=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, add=rx.MomentDelta(hours=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, add=rx.MomentDelta(minutes=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, add=rx.MomentDelta(seconds=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
)
"""
subtract_example = """rx.vstack(
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, subtract=rx.MomentDelta(years=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, subtract=rx.MomentDelta(quarters=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, subtract=rx.MomentDelta(months=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, subtract=rx.MomentDelta(months=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, subtract=rx.MomentDelta(months=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, subtract=rx.MomentDelta(weeks=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, subtract=rx.MomentDelta(days=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, subtract=rx.MomentDelta(hours=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, subtract=rx.MomentDelta(minutes=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, subtract=rx.MomentDelta(seconds=2), format="YYYY-MM-DD - HH:mm:ss"),
)
"""
```

```python eval
rx.tabs(
    rx.tabs.list(
        rx.tabs.trigger("Add", value="add"),
        rx.tabs.trigger("Subtract", value="subtract")
    ),
    rx.tabs.content(docdemo(add_example, comp=eval(add_example)), value="add"),
    rx.tabs.content(docdemo(subtract_example, comp=eval(subtract_example)), value="subtract"),
    default_value="add",
)
```

### Timezones

You can also set dates to display in a specific timezone:

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, tz="America/Los_Angeles"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, tz="Europe/Paris"),
    rx.moment(MomentState.date_now, tz="Asia/Tokyo"),
)
```

### Client-side periodic update

If a date is not passed to `rx.moment`, it will use the client's current time.

If you want to update the date every second, you can use the `interval` prop.

```python demo
rx.moment(interval=1000, format="HH:mm:ss")
```

Even better, you can actually link an event handler to the `on_change` prop that will be called every time the date is updated:

```python demo exec
class MomentLiveState(rx.State):
    updating: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def on_update(self, date):
        return rx.toast(f"Date updated: {date}")

    @rx.event
    def set_updating(self, value: bool):
        self.updating = value

def moment_live_example():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.moment(
            format="HH:mm:ss",
            interval=rx.cond(MomentLiveState.updating, 5000, 0),
            on_change=MomentLiveState.on_update,
        ),
        rx.switch(
            is_checked=MomentLiveState.updating,
            on_change=MomentLiveState.set_updating,
        ),
    )
```

## Setting the type of the Scrollbars

The `type` prop describes the nature of scrollbar visibility.

`auto` means that scrollbars are visible when content is overflowing on the corresponding orientation.

`always` means that scrollbars are always visible regardless of whether the content is overflowing.

`scroll` means that scrollbars are visible when the user is scrolling along its corresponding orientation.

`hover` when the user is scrolling along its corresponding orientation and when the user is hovering over the scroll area.

```python demo
rx.grid(
    rx.scroll_area(
        rx.flex(
            rx.text("type = 'auto'",  weight="bold"),

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# List

A `list` is a component that is used to display a list of items, stacked vertically by default. A `list` can be either `ordered` or `unordered`. It is based on the `flex` component and therefore inherits all of its props.

`list.unordered` has bullet points to display the list items.

```python demo
rx.list.unordered(
    rx.list.item("Example 1"),
    rx.list.item("Example 2"),
    rx.list.item("Example 3"),
)
```

 `list.ordered` has numbers to display the list items.

```python demo
rx.list.ordered(
    rx.list.item("Example 1"),
    rx.list.item("Example 2"),
    rx.list.item("Example 3"),
)
```

`list.unordered()` and `list.ordered()` can have no bullet points or numbers by setting the `list_style_type` prop to `none`.
This is effectively the same as using the `list()` component.

```python demo
rx.hstack(
    rx.list(
        rx.list.item("Example 1"),
        rx.list.item("Example 2"),
        rx.list.item("Example 3"),
    ),
    rx.list.unordered(
        rx.list.item("Example 1"),
        rx.list.item("Example 2"),
        rx.list.item("Example 3"),
        list_style_type="none",
    )
)
```

Lists can also be used with icons.

```python demo
rx.list(
    rx.list.item(
        rx.icon("circle_check_big", color="green"), " Allowed",
    ),
    rx.list.item(
        rx.icon("octagon_x", color="red"), " Not",
    ),
    rx.list.item(
        rx.icon("settings", color="grey"), " Settings"
    ),
    list_style_type="none",
)
```

components:
    - rx.callout.root
    - rx.callout.icon
    - rx.callout.text
---


```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Callout

A `callout` is a short message to attract user's attention.

```python demo
rx.callout.root(
    rx.callout.icon(rx.icon(tag="info")),
    rx.callout.text("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application."),
)
```

The `callout` component is made up of a `callout.root`, which groups `callout.icon` and `callout.text` parts. This component is based on the `div` element and supports common margin props.

The `callout.icon` provides width and height for the `icon` associated with the `callout`. This component is based on the `div` element. See the [**icon** component for all icons that are available.](/docs/library/datadisplay/icon/)

The `callout.text` renders the callout text. This component is based on the `p` element.

## As alert

```python demo
rx.callout.root(
    rx.callout.icon(rx.icon(tag="triangle_alert")),
    rx.callout.text("Access denied. Please contact the network administrator to view this page."),
    color_scheme="red",
    role="alert",
)
```

## Style

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.callout.root(
        rx.callout.icon(rx.icon(tag="info")),
        rx.callout.text("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application."),
        size="3",
    ),
    rx.callout.root(
        rx.callout.icon(rx.icon(tag="info")),
        rx.callout.text("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application."),
        size="2",
    ),
    rx.callout.root(
        rx.callout.icon(rx.icon(tag="info")),
        rx.callout.text("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application."),
        size="1",
    ),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
    align="start",
)
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style. It is set to `soft` by default.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.callout.root(
        rx.callout.icon(rx.icon(tag="info")),
        rx.callout.text("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application."),
        variant="soft",
    ),
    rx.callout.root(
        rx.callout.icon(rx.icon(tag="info")),
        rx.callout.text("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application."),
        variant="surface",
    ),
    rx.callout.root(
        rx.callout.icon(rx.icon(tag="info")),
        rx.callout.text("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application."),
        variant="outline",
    ),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

### Color

Use the `color_scheme` prop to assign a specific color, ignoring the global theme.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.callout.root(
        rx.callout.icon(rx.icon(tag="info")),
        rx.callout.text("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application."),
        color_scheme="blue",
    ),
    rx.callout.root(
        rx.callout.icon(rx.icon(tag="info")),
        rx.callout.text("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application."),
        color_scheme="green",
    ),
    rx.callout.root(
        rx.callout.icon(rx.icon(tag="info")),
        rx.callout.text("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application."),
        color_scheme="red",
    ),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

### High Contrast

Use the `high_contrast` prop to add additional contrast.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.callout.root(
        rx.callout.icon(rx.icon(tag="info")),
        rx.callout.text("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application."),
    ),
    rx.callout.root(
        rx.callout.icon(rx.icon(tag="info")),
        rx.callout.text("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application."),
        high_contrast=True,
    ),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

    lambda **props: rx.hstack(rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", **props), rx.avatar(fallback="RX", **props), spacing="3")
---
# Avatar

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.templates.docpage import style_grid
```

The Avatar component is used to represent a user, and display their profile pictures or fallback texts such as initials.

## Basic Example

To create an avatar component with an image, pass the image URL as the `src` prop.

```python demo
rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg")
```

To display a text such as initials, set the `fallback` prop without passing the `src` prop.

```python demo
rx.avatar(fallback="RX")
```

## Styling

```python eval
style_grid(component_used=rx.avatar, component_used_str="rx.avatar", variants=["solid", "soft"], fallback="RX")
```

### Size

The `size` prop controls the size and spacing of the avatar. The acceptable size is from `"1"` to `"9"`, with `"3"` being the default.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RX", size="1"),
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RX", size="2"),
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RX", size="3"),
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RX"),
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RX", size="4"),
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RX", size="5"),
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RX", size="6"),
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RX", size="7"),
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RX", size="8"),
    spacing="1",
)
```

### Variant

The `variant` prop controls the visual style of the avatar fallback text. The variant can be `"solid"` or `"soft"`. The default is `"soft"`.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", variant="solid"),
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", variant="soft"),
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX"),
    spacing="2",
)
```

### Color Scheme

The `color_scheme` prop sets a specific color to the fallback text, ignoring the global theme.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", color_scheme="indigo"),
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", color_scheme="cyan"),
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", color_scheme="orange"),
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", color_scheme="crimson"),
    spacing="2",
)
```

### High Contrast

The `high_contrast` prop increases color contrast of the fallback text with the background.

```python demo
rx.grid(
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", variant="solid"),
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", variant="solid", high_contrast=True),
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", variant="soft"),
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", variant="soft", high_contrast=True),
    rows="2",
    spacing="2",
    flow="column",
)
```

### Radius

The `radius` prop sets specific radius value, ignoring the global theme. It can take values `"none" | "small" | "medium" | "large" | "full"`.

```python demo
rx.grid(
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RX", radius="none"),
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", radius="none"),
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RX", radius="small"),
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", radius="small"),
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RX", radius="medium"),
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", radius="medium"),
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RX", radius="large"),
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", radius="large"),
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RX", radius="full"),
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX", radius="full"),
    rows="2",
    spacing="2",
    flow="column",
)
```

### Fallback

The `fallback` prop indicates the rendered text when the `src` cannot be loaded.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.avatar(fallback="RX"),
    rx.avatar(fallback="PC"),
    spacing="2",
)
```

## Final Example

As part of a user profile page, the Avatar component is used to display the user's profile picture, with the fallback text showing the user's initials. Text components displays the user's full name and username handle and a Button component shows the edit profile button.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.avatar(src="/logo.jpg", fallback="RU", size="9"),
    rx.text("Reflex User", weight="bold", size="4"),
    rx.text("@reflexuser", color_scheme="gray"),
    rx.button("Edit Profile", color_scheme="indigo", variant="solid"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="1",
)
```

components:
    - rx.lucide.Icon
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.components.icons.lucide.lucide import lucide_icons
```

# Icon

The Icon component is used to display an icon from a library of icons. This implementation is based on the [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons) where you can find a list of all available icons.


## Icons List

```python eval
lucide_icons()
```

## Basic Example

To display an icon, specify the `tag` prop from the list of available icons.
Passing the tag as the first children is also supported and will be assigned to the `tag` prop.

The `tag` is expected to be in `snake_case` format, but `kebab-case` is also supported to allow copy-paste from [https://lucide.dev/icons](https://lucide.dev/icons).

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.icon("calendar"),
    rx.icon(tag="calendar"),
    gap="2",
)
```

## Dynamic Icons

There are two ways to use dynamic icons in Reflex:

### Using rx.match

If you have a specific subset of icons you want to use dynamically, you can define an `rx.match` with them:

```python
def dynamic_icon_with_match(icon_name):
    return rx.match(
        icon_name,
        ("plus", rx.icon("plus")),
        ("minus", rx.icon("minus")),
        ("equal", rx.icon("equal")),
    )
```

```python exec
def dynamic_icon_with_match(icon_name):
    return rx.match(
        icon_name,
        ("plus", rx.icon("plus")),
        ("minus", rx.icon("minus")),
        ("equal", rx.icon("equal")),
    )
```

### Using Dynamic Icon Tags

Reflex also supports using dynamic values directly as the `tag` prop in `rx.icon()`. This allows you to use any icon from the Lucide library dynamically at runtime.

```python exec
class DynamicIconState(rx.State):
    current_icon: str = "heart"
    
    def change_icon(self):
        icons = ["heart", "star", "bell", "calendar", "settings"]
        import random
        self.current_icon = random.choice(icons)
```

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.heading("Dynamic Icon Example"),
    rx.icon(DynamicIconState.current_icon, size=30, color="red"),
    rx.button("Change Icon", on_click=DynamicIconState.change_icon),
    spacing="4",
    align="center",
)
```

Under the hood, when a dynamic value is passed as the `tag` prop to `rx.icon()`, Reflex automatically uses a special `DynamicIcon` component that can load icons at runtime.

```md alert
When using dynamic icons, make sure the icon names are valid. Invalid icon names will cause runtime errors.
```

## Styling

Icon from Lucide can be customized with the following props `stroke_width`, `size` and `color`.

### Stroke Width

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.icon("moon", stroke_width=1),
    rx.icon("moon", stroke_width=1.5),
    rx.icon("moon", stroke_width=2),
    rx.icon("moon", stroke_width=2.5),
    gap="2"
)
```


### Size

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=15),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=20),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=25),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=30),
    align="center",
    gap="2",
)
```

### Color

Here is an example using basic colors in icons.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color="indigo"),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color="cyan"),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color="orange"),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color="crimson"),
    gap="2",
)
```

A radix color with a scale may also be specified using `rx.color()` as seen below.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("purple", 1)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("purple", 2)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("purple", 3)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("purple", 4)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("purple", 5)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("purple", 6)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("purple", 7)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("purple", 8)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("purple", 9)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("purple", 10)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("purple", 11)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("purple", 12)),
    gap="2",
)
```

Here is another example using the `accent` color with scales. The `accent` is the most dominant color in your theme.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("accent", 1)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("accent", 2)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("accent", 3)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("accent", 4)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("accent", 5)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("accent", 6)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("accent", 7)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("accent", 8)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("accent", 9)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("accent", 10)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("accent", 11)),
    rx.icon("zoom_in", size=18, color=rx.color("accent", 12)),
    gap="2",
)
```


## Final Example

Icons can be used as child components of many other components. For example, adding a magnifying glass icon to a search bar.

```python demo
rx.badge(
    rx.flex(
        rx.icon("search", size=18),
        rx.text("Search documentation...", size="3", weight="medium"),
        direction="row",
        gap="1",
        align="center",
    ),
    size="2",
    radius="full",
    color_scheme="gray",
)
```

components:
    - rx.badge

Badge: |
    lambda **props: rx.badge("Basic Badge", **props)
---
# Badge

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.templates.docpage import style_grid
```

Badges are used to highlight an item's status for quick recognition.

## Basic Example

To create a badge component with only text inside, pass the text as an argument.

```python demo
rx.badge("New")
```

## Styling

```python eval
style_grid(component_used=rx.badge, component_used_str="rx.badge", variants=["solid", "soft", "surface", "outline"], components_passed="England!",)
```

### Size

The `size` prop controls the size and padding of a badge. It can take values of `"1" | "2"`, with default being `"1"`.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.badge("New"),
    rx.badge("New", size="1"),
    rx.badge("New", size="2"),
    align="center",
    spacing="2",
)
```

### Variant

The `variant` prop controls the visual style of the badge. The supported variant types are `"solid" | "soft" | "surface" | "outline"`. The variant default is `"soft"`.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.badge("New", variant="solid"),
    rx.badge("New", variant="soft"),
    rx.badge("New"),
    rx.badge("New", variant="surface"),
    rx.badge("New", variant="outline"),
    spacing="2",
)
```

### Color Scheme

The `color_scheme` prop sets a specific color, ignoring the global theme.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.badge("New", color_scheme="indigo"),
    rx.badge("New", color_scheme="cyan"),
    rx.badge("New", color_scheme="orange"),
    rx.badge("New", color_scheme="crimson"),
    spacing="2",
)
```

### High Contrast

The `high_contrast` prop increases color contrast of the fallback text with the background.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.flex(
        rx.badge("New", variant="solid"),
        rx.badge("New", variant="soft"),
        rx.badge("New", variant="surface"),
        rx.badge("New", variant="outline"),
        spacing="2",
    ),
    rx.flex(
        rx.badge("New", variant="solid", high_contrast=True),
        rx.badge("New", variant="soft", high_contrast=True),
        rx.badge("New", variant="surface", high_contrast=True),
        rx.badge("New", variant="outline", high_contrast=True),
        spacing="2",
    ),
    direction="column",
    spacing="2",
)
```

### Radius

The `radius` prop sets specific radius value, ignoring the global theme. It can take values `"none" | "small" | "medium" | "large" | "full"`.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.badge("New", radius="none"),
    rx.badge("New", radius="small"),
    rx.badge("New", radius="medium"),
    rx.badge("New", radius="large"),
    rx.badge("New", radius="full"),
    spacing="3",
)
```

## Final Example

A badge may contain more complex elements within it. This example uses a `flex` component to align an icon and the text correctly, using the `gap` prop to
ensure a comfortable spacing between the two.

```python demo
rx.badge(
    rx.flex(
        rx.icon(tag="arrow_up"),
        rx.text("8.8%"),
        spacing="1",
    ),
    color_scheme="grass",
)
```

components:
    - rx.spinner
---

# Spinner

Spinner is used to display an animated loading indicator when a task is in progress.

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

```python demo
rx.spinner()
```

## Basic Examples

Spinner can have different sizes.

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.hstack(
        rx.spinner(size="1"),
        rx.spinner(size="2"),
        rx.spinner(size="3"),
        align="center",
        gap="1em"
    )
)
```

## Demo with buttons

Buttons have their own loading prop that automatically composes a spinner.

```python demo
rx.button("Bookmark", loading=True)
```

## Spinner inside a button

If you have an icon inside the button, you can use the button's disabled state and wrap the icon in a standalone rx.spinner to achieve a more sophisticated design.

```python demo
rx.button(
    rx.spinner(
        loading=True
    ),
    "Bookmark",
    disabled=True
)
```

        ),
    )
---

```python exec

# Data List

The `DataList` component displays key-value pairs and is particularly helpful for showing metadata.

A `DataList` needs to be initialized using `rx.data_list.root()` and currently takes in data list items: `rx.data_list.item`

```python demo
rx.card(
                rx.data_list.root(
                    rx.data_list.item(
                        rx.data_list.label("Status"),
                        rx.data_list.value(
                            rx.badge(
                                "Authorized",
                                variant="soft",
                                radius="full",
                            )
                        ),
                        align="center",
                    ),
                    rx.data_list.item(
                        rx.data_list.label("ID"),
                        rx.data_list.value(rx.code("U-474747")),
                    ),
                    rx.data_list.item(
                        rx.data_list.label("Name"),
                        rx.data_list.value("Developer Success"),
                        align="center",
                    ),
                    rx.data_list.item(
                        rx.data_list.label("Email"),
                        rx.data_list.value(
                            rx.link(
                                "success@reflex.dev",
                                href="mailto:success@reflex.dev",
                            ),
                        ),
                    ),
                    rx.data_list.item(
                        rx.data_list.label("Company"),
                        rx.data_list.value(
                            rx.link(

Progress: |
    lambda **props: rx.progress(value=50, **props)
---

# Progress

Progress is used to display the progress status for a task that takes a long time or consists of several steps.

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```
## Basic Example

`rx.progress` expects the `value` prop to set the progress value.
`width` is default to 100%, the width of its parent component.

```python demo
rx.vstack(
    rx.progress(value=0),
    rx.progress(value=50),
    rx.progress(value=100),
    width="50%",
)
```

For a dynamic progress, you can assign a state variable to the `value` prop instead of a constant value.

```python demo exec
import asyncio

class ProgressState(rx.State):
    value: int = 0

    @rx.event(background=True)
    async def start_progress(self):
        async with self:
            self.value = 0
        while self.value < 100:
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
            async with self:
                self.value += 1


def live_progress():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.progress(value=ProgressState.value), 
        rx.button("Start", on_click=ProgressState.start_progress),
        width="50%"
    )
```

        **props
    )
---


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages import docs
```

# Callout

A `callout` is a short message to attract user's attention.

```python demo
rx.callout("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application.", icon="info")
```

The `icon` prop allows an icon to be passed to the `callout` component. See the [**icon** component for all icons that are available.](/docs/library/data-display/icon)

## As alert

```python demo
rx.callout("Access denied. Please contact the network administrator to view this page.", icon="triangle_alert", color_scheme="red", role="alert")
```

## Style

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.callout("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application.", icon="info", size="3",),
    rx.callout("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application.", icon="info", size="2",),
    rx.callout("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application.", icon="info", size="1",),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
    align="start",
)
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style. It is set to `soft` by default.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.callout("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application.", icon="info", variant="soft",),
    rx.callout("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application.", icon="info", variant="surface",),
    rx.callout("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application.", icon="info", variant="outline",),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

### Color

Use the `color_scheme` prop to assign a specific color, ignoring the global theme.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.callout("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application.", icon="info", color_scheme="blue",),
    rx.callout("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application.", icon="info", color_scheme="green",),
    rx.callout("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application.", icon="info", color_scheme="red",),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

### High Contrast

Use the `high_contrast` prop to add additional contrast.

```python demo
rx.flex(
    rx.callout("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application.", icon="info",),
    rx.callout("You will need admin privileges to install and access this application.", icon="info", high_contrast=True,),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

components:
    - rx.code_block
---

```python exec

```

# Code Block

The Code Block component can be used to display code easily within a website.
Put in a multiline string with the correct spacing and specify and language to show the desired code.

```python demo
rx.code_block(
    """def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return(fib(n-1) + fib(n-2))""",
    language="python",
    show_line_numbers=True,
)
```


---
components:
    - rx.data_table
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import library
```

# Data Table

The data table component is a great way to display static data in a table format.
You can pass in a pandas dataframe to the data prop to create the table.

In this example we will read data from a csv file, convert it to a pandas dataframe and display it in a data_table.

We will also add a search, pagination, sorting to the data_table to make it more accessible.

If you want to [add, edit or remove data]({library.tables_and_data_grids.table.path}) in your app or deal with anything but static data then the [`rx.table`]({library.tables_and_data_grids.table.path}) might be a better fit for your use case.


```python demo box
rx.data_table(
    data=[
        ["Avery Bradley", "6-2", 25.0],
        ["Jae Crowder", "6-6", 25.0],
        ["John Holland", "6-5", 27.0],
        ["R.J. Hunter", "6-5", 22.0],
        ["Jonas Jerebko", "6-10", 29.0],
        ["Amir Johnson", "6-9", 29.0],
        ["Jordan Mickey", "6-8", 21.0],
        ["Kelly Olynyk", "7-0", 25.0],
        ["Terry Rozier", "6-2", 22.0],
        ["Marcus Smart", "6-4", 22.0],
    ],
    columns=["Name", "Height", "Age"],
    pagination=True,
    search=True,
    sort=True,
)
```

```python
import pandas as pd
nba_data = pd.read_csv("data/nba.csv")
...
rx.data_table(
    data = nba_data[["Name", "Height", "Age"]],
    pagination= True,
    search= True,
    sort= True,
)  
```

📊 **Dataset source:** [nba.csv](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/nba.csv)

The example below shows how to create a data table from from a list.

```python
class State(rx.State):
    data: List = [
        ["Lionel", "Messi", "PSG"],
        ["Christiano", "Ronaldo", "Al-Nasir"]
     ]
    columns: List[str] = ["First Name", "Last Name"]
    
def index():  
    return rx.data_table(
        data=State.data,
        columns=State.columns,

# Table

A semantic table for presenting tabular data.

If you just want to [represent static data]({library.tables_and_data_grids.data_table.path}) then the [`rx.data_table`]({library.tables_and_data_grids.data_table.path}) might be a better fit for your use case as it comes with in-built pagination, search and sorting.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.table.root(
    rx.table.header(
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Full name"),
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Group"),
        ),
    ),
    rx.table.body(
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.row_header_cell("Danilo Sousa"),
            rx.table.cell("danilo@example.com"),
            rx.table.cell("Developer"),
        ),
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.row_header_cell("Zahra Ambessa"),
            rx.table.cell("zahra@example.com"),
            rx.table.cell("Admin"),
        ),rx.table.row(
            rx.table.row_header_cell("Jasper Eriks"),
            rx.table.cell("jasper@example.com"),
            rx.table.cell("Developer"),
        ),
    ),
    width="100%",
)
```

```md alert info
# Set the table `width` to fit within its container and prevent it from overflowing.
```

## Showing State data (using foreach)

Many times there is a need for the data we represent in our table to be dynamic. Dynamic data must be in `State`. Later we will show an example of how to access data from a database and how to load data from a source file.

In this example there is a `people` data structure in `State` that is [iterated through using `rx.foreach`]({components.rendering_iterables.path}).

```python demo exec
class TableForEachState(rx.State):
    people: list[list] = [
        ["Danilo Sousa", "danilo@example.com", "Developer"],
        ["Zahra Ambessa", "zahra@example.com", "Admin"],
        ["Jasper Eriks", "jasper@example.com", "Developer"],
    ]

def show_person(person: list):
    """Show a person in a table row."""
    return rx.table.row(
        rx.table.cell(person[0]),
        rx.table.cell(person[1]),
        rx.table.cell(person[2]),
    )

def foreach_table_example():
    return rx.table.root(
        rx.table.header(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Full name"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Group"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.table.body(rx.foreach(TableForEachState.people, show_person)),
        width="100%",
    )
```

It is also possible to define a `class` such as `Person` below and then iterate through this data structure, as a `list[Person]`.

```python
import dataclasses

@dataclasses.dataclass
class Person:
    full_name: str
    email: str
    group: str
```
## Sorting and Filtering (Searching)

In this example we show two approaches to sort and filter data:
1. Using SQL-like operations for database-backed models (simulated)
2. Using Python operations for in-memory data

Both approaches use the same UI components: `rx.select` for sorting and `rx.input` for filtering.

### Approach 1: Database Filtering and Sorting

For database-backed models, we typically use SQL queries with `select`, `where`, and `order_by`. In this example, we'll simulate this behavior with mock data.


```python demo exec
# Simulating database operations with mock data
class DatabaseTableState(rx.State):
    # Mock data to simulate database records
    users: list = [
        {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "phone": "555-1234", "address": "123 Main St"},
        {"name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@example.com", "phone": "555-5678", "address": "456 Oak Ave"},
        {"name": "Bob Johnson", "email": "bob@example.com", "phone": "555-9012", "address": "789 Pine Rd"},
        {"name": "Alice Brown", "email": "alice@example.com", "phone": "555-3456", "address": "321 Maple Dr"},
    ]
    filtered_users: list[dict] = []
    sort_value = ""
    search_value = ""


    @rx.event
    def load_entries(self):
        """Simulate querying the database with filter and sort."""
        # Start with all users
        result = self.users.copy()

        # Apply filtering if search value exists
        if self.search_value != "":
            search_term = self.search_value.lower()
            result = [
                user for user in result
                if any(search_term in str(value).lower() for value in user.values())
            ]

        # Apply sorting if sort column is selected
        if self.sort_value != "":
            result = sorted(result, key=lambda x: x[self.sort_value])

        self.filtered_users = result
        yield

    @rx.event
    def sort_values(self, sort_value):
        """Update sort value and reload data."""
        self.sort_value = sort_value
        yield DatabaseTableState.load_entries()

    @rx.event
    def filter_values(self, search_value):
        """Update search value and reload data."""
        self.search_value = search_value
        yield DatabaseTableState.load_entries()


def show_customer(user):
    """Show a customer in a table row."""
    return rx.table.row(
        rx.table.cell(user["name"]),
        rx.table.cell(user["email"]),
        rx.table.cell(user["phone"]),
        rx.table.cell(user["address"]),
    )


def database_table_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.select(
            ["name", "email", "phone", "address"],
            placeholder="Sort By: Name",
            on_change=lambda value: DatabaseTableState.sort_values(value),
        ),
        rx.input(
            placeholder="Search here...",
            on_change=lambda value: DatabaseTableState.filter_values(value),
        ),
        rx.table.root(
            rx.table.header(
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Phone"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Address"),
                ),
            ),
            rx.table.body(rx.foreach(DatabaseTableState.filtered_users, show_customer)),
            on_mount=DatabaseTableState.load_entries,
            width="100%",
        ),
        width="100%",
    )
```

### Approach 2: In-Memory Filtering and Sorting

For in-memory data, we use Python operations like `sorted()` and list comprehensions.

The state variable `_people` is set to be a backend-only variable. This is done in case the variable is very large in order to reduce network traffic and improve performance.

When a `select` item is selected, the `on_change` event trigger is hooked up to the `set_sort_value` event handler. Every base var has a built-in event handler to set its value for convenience, called `set_VARNAME`.

`current_people` is an `rx.var(cache=True)`. It is a var that is only recomputed when the other state vars it depends on change. This ensures that the `People` shown in the table are always up to date whenever they are searched or sorted.

```python demo exec
import dataclasses

@dataclasses.dataclass
class Person:
    full_name: str
    email: str
    group: str


class InMemoryTableState(rx.State):

    _people: list[Person] = [
        Person(full_name="Danilo Sousa", email="danilo@example.com", group="Developer"),
        Person(full_name="Zahra Ambessa", email="zahra@example.com", group="Admin"),
        Person(full_name="Jasper Eriks", email="zjasper@example.com", group="B-Developer"),
    ]

    sort_value = ""
    search_value = ""

    @rx.event
    def set_sort_value(self, value: str):
        self.sort_value = value

    @rx.event
    def set_search_value(self, value: str):
        self.search_value = value

    @rx.var(cache=True)
    def current_people(self) -> list[Person]:
        people = self._people

        if self.sort_value != "":
            people = sorted(
                people, key=lambda user: getattr(user, self.sort_value).lower()
            )

        if self.search_value != "":
            people = [
                person for person in people
                if any(
                    self.search_value.lower() in getattr(person, attr).lower()
                    for attr in ['full_name', 'email', 'group']
                )
            ]
        return people


def show_person(person: Person):
    """Show a person in a table row."""
    return rx.table.row(
        rx.table.cell(person.full_name),
        rx.table.cell(person.email),
        rx.table.cell(person.group),
    )

def in_memory_table_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.select(
            ["full_name", "email", "group"],
            placeholder="Sort By: full_name",
            on_change=InMemoryTableState.set_sort_value,
        ),
        rx.input(
            placeholder="Search here...",
            on_change=InMemoryTableState.set_search_value,
        ),
        rx.table.root(
            rx.table.header(
                rx.table.row(
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Full name"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                    rx.table.column_header_cell("Group"),
                ),
            ),
            rx.table.body(rx.foreach(InMemoryTableState.current_people, show_person)),
            width="100%",
        ),
        width="100%",
    )
```

### When to Use Each Approach

- **Database Approach**: Best for large datasets or when the data already exists in a database
- **In-Memory Approach**: Best for smaller datasets, prototyping, or when the data is static or loaded from an API

Both approaches provide the same user experience with filtering and sorting functionality.

# Database

The more common use case for building an `rx.table` is to use data from a database.

The code below shows how to load data from a database and place it in an `rx.table`.

## Loading data into table

A `Customer` [model]({database.tables.path}) is defined that inherits from `rx.Model`.

The `load_entries` event handler executes a [query]({database.queries.path}) that is used to request information from a database table. This `load_entries` event handler is called on the `on_mount` event trigger of the `rx.table.root`.

If you want to load the data when the page in the app loads you can set `on_load` in `app.add_page()` to equal this event handler, like `app.add_page(page_name, on_load=State.load_entries)`.

```python
class Customer(rx.Model, table=True):
    """The customer model."""
    name: str
    email: str
    phone: str
    address: str
```

```python exec
class DatabaseTableState(rx.State):

    users: list[dict] = []

    @rx.event
    def load_entries(self):
        """Get all users from the database."""
        customers_json = [
            {
                "name": "John Doe",
                "email": "john@example.com",
                "phone": "555-1234",
                "address": "123 Main St"
            },
            {
                "name": "Jane Smith",
                "email": "jane@example.com",
                "phone": "555-5678",
                "address": "456 Oak Ave"
            },
            {
                "name": "Bob Johnson",
                "email": "bob@example.com",
                "phone": "555-9012",
                "address": "789 Pine Blvd"
            },
            {
                "name": "Alice Williams",
                "email": "alice@example.com",
                "phone": "555-3456",
                "address": "321 Maple Dr"
            }
        ]
        self.users = customers_json

def show_customer(user: dict):
    return rx.table.row(
        rx.table.cell(user["name"]),
        rx.table.cell(user["email"]),
        rx.table.cell(user["phone"]),
        rx.table.cell(user["address"]),
    )

def loading_data_table_example():
    return rx.table.root(
    rx.table.header(
        rx.table.row(
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Phone"),
            rx.table.column_header_cell("Address"),
        ),
    ),
    rx.table.body(rx.foreach(DatabaseTableState.users, show_customer)),
    on_mount=DatabaseTableState.load_entries,
    width="100%",
    margin_bottom="1em",
)
```

```python eval
loading_data_table_example()
```

```python
from sqlmodel import select

class DatabaseTableState(rx.State):

    users: list[Customer] = []

    @rx.event
    def load_entries(self):
        """Get all users from the database."""
        with rx.session() as session:
            self.users = session.exec(select(Customer)).all()


def show_customer(user: Customer):
    """Show a customer in a table row."""
    return rx.table.row(
        rx.table.cell(user.name),
        rx.table.cell(user.email),
        rx.table.cell(user.phone),
        rx.table.cell(user.address),
    )

def loading_data_table_example():
    return rx.table.root(
        rx.table.header(
            rx.table.row(
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Name"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Email"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Phone"),
                rx.table.column_header_cell("Address"),
            ),
        ),
        rx.table.body(rx.foreach(DatabaseTableState.users, show_customer)),
        on_mount=DatabaseTableState.load_entries,
        width="100%",
    )

```

## Filtering (Searching) and Sorting

In this example we sort and filter the data.

For sorting the `rx.select` component is used. The data is sorted based on the attributes of the `Customer` class. When a select item is selected, as the `on_change` event trigger is hooked up to the `sort_values` event handler, the data is sorted based on the state variable `sort_value` attribute selected.

The sorting query gets the `sort_column` based on the state variable `sort_value`, it gets the order using the `asc` function from sql and finally uses the `order_by` function.

For filtering the `rx.input` component is used. The data is filtered based on the search query entered into the `rx.input` component. When a search query is entered, as the `on_change` event trigger is hooked up to the `filter_values` event handler, the data is filtered based on if the state variable `search_value` is present in any of the data in that specific `Customer`.

The `%` character before and after `search_value` makes it a wildcard pattern that matches any sequence of characters before or after the `search_value`. `query.where(...)` modifies the existing query to include a filtering condition. The `or_` operator is a logical OR operator that combines multiple conditions. The query will return results that match any of these conditions. `Customer.name.ilike(search_value)` checks if the `name` column of the `Customer` table matches the `search_value` pattern in a case-insensitive manner (`ilike` stands for "case-insensitive like").

## Pagination

Pagination is an important part of database management, especially when working with large datasets. It helps in enabling efficient data retrieval by breaking down results into manageable loads.

The purpose of this code is to retrieve a specific subset of rows from the `Customer` table based on the specified pagination parameters `offset` and `limit`.

`query.offset(self.offset)` modifies the query to skip a certain number of rows before returning the results. The number of rows to skip is specified by `self.offset`.

`query.limit(self.limit)` modifies the query to limit the number of rows returned. The maximum number of rows to return is specified by `self.limit`.

```python exec
class DatabaseTableState3(rx.State):

    _mock_data: list[Customer] = [
        Customer(name="John Doe", email="john@example.com", phone="555-1234", address="123 Main St"),

The real power of the `rx.table` comes where you are able to visualise, add and edit data live in your app. Check out these apps and code to see how this is done: app: https://customer-data-app.reflex.run code: https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex-examples/tree/main/customer_data_app and code: https://github.com/reflex-dev/data-viewer.

# Download

Most users will want to download their data after they have got the subset that they would like in their table.

In this example there are buttons to download the data as a `json` and as a `csv`.

For the `json` download the `rx.download` is in the frontend code attached to the `on_click` event trigger for the button. This works because if the `Var` is not already a string, it will be converted to a string using `JSON.stringify`.

For the `csv` download the `rx.download` is in the backend code as an event_handler `download_csv_data`. There is also a helper function `_convert_to_csv` that converts the data in `self.users` to `csv` format.

```python exec

class TableDownloadState(rx.State):
    _mock_data: list[Customer] = [

# Data Editor

A datagrid editor based on [Glide Data Grid](https://grid.glideapps.com/)

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.pages.docs import library
from typing import Any

columns: list[dict[str, str]] = [
    {
        "title":"Code",
        "type": "str",
    },
    {
        "title":"Value",
        "type": "int",
    }, 
    {
        "title":"Activated",
        "type": "bool",
    },
]
data: list[list[Any]] = [
    ["A", 1, True],
    ["B", 2, False],
    ["C", 3, False],
    ["D", 4, True],
    ["E", 5, True],
    ["F", 6, False],
]

```

This component is introduced as an alternative to the [datatable]({library.tables_and_data_grids.data_table.path}) to support editing the displayed data.

## Columns

The columns definition should be a `list` of `dict`, each `dict` describing the associated columns.
Property of a column dict:

- `title`: The text to display in the header of the column.
- `id`: An id for the column, if not defined, will default to a lower case of `title`
- `width`: The width of the column.
- `type`: The type of the columns, default to `"str"`.

## Data

The `data` props of `rx.data_editor` accept a `list` of `list`, where each `list` represent a row of data to display in the table.

## Simple Example

Here is a basic example of using the data_editor representing data with no interaction and no styling. Below we define the `columns` and the `data` which are taken in by the `rx.data_editor` component. When we define the `columns` we must define a `title` and a `type` for each column we create. The columns in the `data` must then match the defined `type` or errors will be thrown.

```python demo box
rx.data_editor(
    columns=columns,
    data=data,
)
```

```python
columns: list[dict[str, str]] = [
    {
        "title":"Code",
        "type": "str",
    },
    {
        "title":"Value",
        "type": "int",
    }, 
    {
        "title":"Activated",
        "type": "bool",
    },
]
data: list[list[Any]] = [
    ["A", 1, True],
    ["B", 2, False],
    ["C", 3, False],
    ["D", 4, True],
    ["E", 5, True],
    ["F", 6, False],
]
```

```python
rx.data_editor(
    columns=columns,
    data=data,
)
```

## Interactive Example

```python exec
class DataEditorState_HP(rx.State):

    clicked_data: str = "Cell clicked: "
    cols: list[Any] = [
        {"title": "Title", "type": "str"},
        {
            "title": "Name",
            "type": "str",
            "group": "Data",
            "width": 300,
        },
        {
            "title": "Birth",
            "type": "str",
            "id": "date",
            "group": "Data",
            "width": 150,
        },
        {
            "title": "Human",
            "type": "bool",
            "group": "Data",
            "width": 80,
        },
        {
            "title": "House",
            "type": "str",
            "id": "date",
            "group": "Data",
        },
        {
            "title": "Wand",
            "type": "str",
            "id": "date",
            "group": "Data",
            "width": 250,
        },
        {
            "title": "Patronus",
            "type": "str",
            "id": "date",
            "group": "Data",
        },
        {
            "title": "Blood status",
            "type": "str",
            "id": "date",
            "group": "Data",
            "width": 200,
        }
    ]

    data = [
        ["1", "Harry James Potter", "31 July 1980", True, "Gryffindor", "11'  Holly  phoenix feather", "Stag", "Half-blood"],
        ["2", "Ronald Bilius Weasley", "1 March 1980", True,"Gryffindor", "12' Ash unicorn tail hair", "Jack Russell terrier", "Pure-blood"],
        ["3", "Hermione Jean Granger", "19 September, 1979", True, "Gryffindor", "10¾'  vine wood dragon heartstring", "Otter", "Muggle-born"], 
        ["4", "Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore", "Late August 1881", True, "Gryffindor", "15' Elder Thestral tail hair core", "Phoenix", "Half-blood"], 
        ["5", "Rubeus Hagrid", "6 December 1928", False, "Gryffindor", "16'  Oak unknown core", "None", "Part-Human (Half-giant)"], 
        ["6", "Fred Weasley", "1 April, 1978", True, "Gryffindor", "Unknown", "Unknown", "Pure-blood"], 
    ]

    def click_cell(self, pos):
        col, row = pos
        yield self.get_clicked_data(pos)
        

    def get_clicked_data(self, pos) -> str:
        self.clicked_data = f"Cell clicked: {pos}"
        
```

Here we define a State, as shown below, that allows us to print the location of the cell as a heading when we click on it, using the `on_cell_clicked` `event trigger`. Check out all the other `event triggers` that you can use with datatable at the bottom of this page. We also define a `group` with a label `Data`. This groups all the columns with this `group` label under a larger group `Data` as seen in the table below.

```python demo box
rx.heading(DataEditorState_HP.clicked_data)
```

```python demo box
rx.data_editor(
    columns=DataEditorState_HP.cols,
    data=DataEditorState_HP.data,
    on_cell_clicked=DataEditorState_HP.click_cell,
)
```

```python
class DataEditorState_HP(rx.State):
    
    clicked_data: str = "Cell clicked: "

    cols: list[Any] = [
        {
            "title": "Title", 
            "type": "str"

        yield self.get_clicked_data(pos)
        

    def get_clicked_data(self, pos) -> str:
        self.clicked_data = f"Cell clicked: \{pos}"
```

```python
rx.data_editor(
    columns=DataEditorState_HP.cols,
    data=DataEditorState_HP.data,
    on_cell_clicked=DataEditorState_HP.click_cell,
)
```

## Styling Example

Now let's style our datatable to make it look more aesthetic and easier to use. We must first import `DataEditorTheme` and then we can start setting our style props as seen below in `dark_theme`.

We then set these themes using `theme=DataEditorTheme(**dark_theme)`. On top of the styling we can also set some `props` to make some other aesthetic changes to our datatable. We have set the `row_height` to equal `50` so that the content is easier to read. We have also made the `smooth_scroll_x` and `smooth_scroll_y` equal `True` so that we can smoothly scroll along the columns and rows. Finally, we added `column_select=single`, where column select can take any of the following values `none`, `single` or `multiple`.

```python exec
from reflex.components.datadisplay.dataeditor import DataEditorTheme
dark_theme = {
    "accentColor": "#8c96ff",
    "accentLight": "rgba(202, 206, 255, 0.253)",

# Reference

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

The Reference components in Recharts, including ReferenceLine, ReferenceArea, and ReferenceDot, are used to add visual aids and annotations to the chart, helping to highlight specific data points, ranges, or thresholds for better data interpretation and analysis.

## Reference Area

The `rx.recharts.reference_area` component in Recharts is used to highlight a specific area or range on the chart by drawing a rectangular region. It is defined by specifying the coordinates (x1, x2, y1, y2) and can be used to emphasize important data ranges or intervals on the chart.

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "x": 45,
    "y": 100,
    "z": 150,
    "errorY": [
      30,
      20
    ],
    "errorX": 5
  },
  {
    "x": 100,
    "y": 200,
    "z": 200,
    "errorY": [
      20,
      30
    ],
    "errorX": 3
  },
  {
    "x": 120,
    "y": 100,
    "z": 260,
    "errorY": 20,
    "errorX": [
      10,
      3
    ]
  },
  {
    "x": 170,
    "y": 300,
    "z": 400,
    "errorY": [
      15,
      18
    ],
    "errorX": 4
  },
  {
    "x": 140,
    "y": 250,
    "z": 280,
    "errorY": 23,
    "errorX": [
      6,
      7
    ]
  },
  {
    "x": 150,
    "y": 400,
    "z": 500,
    "errorY": [
      21,
      10
    ],
    "errorX": 4
  },
  {
    "x": 110,
    "y": 280,
    "z": 200,
    "errorY": 21,
    "errorX": [
      1,
      8
    ]
  }
]

def reference():
  return rx.recharts.scatter_chart(
    rx.recharts.scatter(
        data=data,
        fill="#8884d8",
        name="A"),
    rx.recharts.reference_area(x1= 150, x2=180, y1=150, y2=300, fill="#8884d8", fill_opacity=0.3),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="x", name="x", type_="number"), 
    rx.recharts.y_axis(data_key="y", name="y", type_="number"),
    rx.recharts.graphing_tooltip(),
    width = "100%", 
    height = 300,
  )
```

## Reference Line

The `rx.recharts.reference_line` component in rx.recharts is used to draw a horizontal or vertical line on the chart at a specified position. It helps to highlight important values, thresholds, or ranges on the axis, providing visual reference points for better data interpretation.

```python demo graphing
data_2 = [

## Reference Dot

The `rx.recharts.reference_dot` component in Recharts is used to mark a specific data point on the chart with a customizable dot. It allows you to highlight important values, outliers, or thresholds by providing a visual reference marker at the specified coordinates (x, y) on the chart.

```python demo graphing

data_3 = [
    {
        "x": 45,
        "y": 100,
        "z": 150,

# Cartesian Grid

The Cartesian Grid is a component in Recharts that provides a visual reference for data points in charts. It helps users to better interpret the data by adding horizontal and vertical lines across the chart area.

## Simple Example

The `stroke_dasharray` prop in Recharts is used to create dashed or dotted lines for various chart elements like lines, axes, or grids. It's based on the SVG stroke-dasharray attribute. The `stroke_dasharray` prop accepts a comma-separated string of numbers that define a repeating pattern of dashes and gaps along the length of the stroke.

- `stroke_dasharray="5,5"`:  creates a line with 5-pixel dashes and 5-pixel gaps
- `stroke_dasharray="10,5,5,5"`:  creates a more complex pattern with 10-pixel dashes, 5-pixel gaps, 5-pixel dashes, and 5-pixel gaps

Here's a simple example using it on a Line component:

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 9800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181
  },
  {
    "name": "Page F",
    "uv": 2390,
    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def cgrid_simple():
  return rx.recharts.line_chart(
    rx.recharts.line(
        data_key="pv",
    ),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(),
    rx.recharts.cartesian_grid(stroke_dasharray="4 4"),
    data=data,
    width = "100%",
    height = 300,
  )
```

## Hidden Axes

A `cartesian_grid` component can be used to hide the horizontal and vertical grid lines in a chart by setting the `horizontal` and `vertical` props to `False`. This can be useful when you want to show the grid lines only on one axis or when you want to create a cleaner look for the chart.

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 9800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181
  },
  {
    "name": "Page F",
    "uv": 2390,
    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def cgrid_hidden():
  return rx.recharts.area_chart(
    rx.recharts.area(
        data_key="uv",
        stroke="#8884d8",
        fill="#8884d8"
    ),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(),
    rx.recharts.cartesian_grid(
      stroke_dasharray="2 4",
      vertical=False,
      horizontal=True,
    ),
    data=data,
    width = "100%",
    height = 300,
  )
```

## Custom Grid Lines

The `horizontal_points` and `vertical_points` props allow you to specify custom grid lines on the chart, offering fine-grained control over the grid's appearance.

These props accept arrays of numbers, where each number represents a pixel offset:
- For `horizontal_points`, the offset is measured from the top edge of the chart
- For `vertical_points`, the offset is measured from the left edge of the chart

```md alert info
# **Important**: The values provided to these props are not directly related to the axis values. They represent pixel offsets within the chart's rendering area.
```

Here's an example demonstrating custom grid lines in a scatter chart:

```python demo graphing

data2 = [
    {"x": 100, "y": 200, "z": 200},
    {"x": 120, "y": 100, "z": 260},
    {"x": 170, "y": 300, "z": 400},
    {"x": 170, "y": 250, "z": 280},
    {"x": 150, "y": 400, "z": 500},
    {"x": 110, "y": 280, "z": 200},
    {"x": 200, "y": 150, "z": 300},
    {"x": 130, "y": 350, "z": 450},
    {"x": 90, "y": 220, "z": 180},
    {"x": 180, "y": 320, "z": 350},
    {"x": 140, "y": 230, "z": 320},
    {"x": 160, "y": 180, "z": 240},
]

def cgrid_custom():
    return rx.recharts.scatter_chart(
        rx.recharts.scatter(
            data=data2,
            fill="#8884d8",
        ),
        rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="x", type_="number"),
        rx.recharts.y_axis(data_key="y"),
        rx.recharts.cartesian_grid(
            stroke_dasharray="3 3",
            horizontal_points=[0, 25, 50],
            vertical_points=[65, 90, 115],
        ),
        width = "100%",
        height = 200,
    )
```

Use these props judiciously to enhance data visualization without cluttering the chart. They're particularly useful for highlighting specific data ranges or creating visual reference points.

components:
    - rx.recharts.Legend

# Legend

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

A legend tells what each plot represents. Just like on a map, the legend helps the reader understand what they are looking at. For a line graph for example it tells us what each line represents.

## Simple Example

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 9800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181
  },
  {
    "name": "Page F",
    "uv": 2390,
    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def legend_simple():
  return rx.recharts.composed_chart(
    rx.recharts.area(
        data_key="uv",
        stroke="#8884d8",
        fill="#8884d8"
    ), 
    rx.recharts.bar(
        data_key="amt",
        bar_size=20,
        fill="#413ea0"
    ),
    rx.recharts.line(
        data_key="pv",
        type_="monotone",
        stroke="#ff7300"
    ), 
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"), 
    rx.recharts.y_axis(),
    rx.recharts.legend(),
    data=data,
    width = "100%",
    height = 300,
  )
```

## Example with Props

The style and layout of the legend can be customized using a set of props. `width` and `height` set the dimensions of the container that wraps the legend, and `layout` can set the legend to display vertically or horizontally. `align` and `vertical_align` set the position relative to the chart container. The type and size of icons can be set using `icon_size` and `icon_type`.

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,

# Axis

The Axis component in Recharts is a powerful tool for customizing and configuring the axes of your charts. It provides a wide range of props that allow you to control the appearance, behavior, and formatting of the axis. Whether you're working with an AreaChart, LineChart, or any other chart type, the Axis component enables you to create precise and informative visualizations.

## Basic Example

```python demo graphing

data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 9800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181
  },
  {
    "name": "Page F",
    "uv": 2390,
    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def axis_simple():
    return rx.recharts.area_chart(
        rx.recharts.area(
            data_key="uv",
            stroke=rx.color("accent", 9),
            fill=rx.color("accent", 8),
        ),
        rx.recharts.x_axis(
            data_key="name",
            label={"value": 'Pages', "position": "bottom"},
        ),
        rx.recharts.y_axis(
            data_key="uv",
            label={"value": 'Views', "angle": -90, "position": "left"},
        ),
        data=data,
        width="100%",
        height=300,
        margin={
            "bottom": 40,
            "left": 40,
            "right": 40,
        },
    )
```

## Multiple Axes

Multiple axes can be used for displaying different data series with varying scales or units on the same chart. This allows for a more comprehensive comparison and analysis of the data.

```python demo graphing

data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 9800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181
  },
  {
    "name": "Page F",
    "uv": 2390,
    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def multi_axis():
  return rx.recharts.area_chart(
    rx.recharts.area(
        data_key="uv", stroke="#8884d8", fill="#8884d8", y_axis_id="left",
    ),
    rx.recharts.area(
        data_key="pv", y_axis_id="right", type_="monotone", stroke="#82ca9d", fill="#82ca9d"
    ),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(data_key="uv", y_axis_id="left"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(data_key="pv", y_axis_id="right", orientation="right"),
    rx.recharts.graphing_tooltip(),
    rx.recharts.legend(),
    data=data,
    width = "100%",
    height = 300,
  )

## Choosing Location of Labels for Axes

The axes `label` can take several positions. The example below allows you to try out different locations for the x and y axis labels.

```python demo graphing

class AxisState(rx.State):

    label_positions: list[str] = ["center", "insideTopLeft", "insideTopRight", "insideBottomRight", "insideBottomLeft", "insideTop", "insideBottom", "insideLeft", "insideRight", "outside", "top", "bottom", "left", "right"]

    label_offsets: list[str] = ["-30", "-20", "-10", "0", "10", "20", "30"]

    x_axis_postion: str = "bottom"

    x_axis_offset: int

    y_axis_postion: str = "left"

    y_axis_offset: int

    @rx.event
    @rx.event
    def set_y_axis_position(self, position: str):
        self.y_axis_position = position

    @rx.event
    def set_x_axis_position(self, position: str):
        self.x_axis_position = position

    @rx.event
    def set_x_axis_offset(self, offset: str):
        self.x_axis_offset = int(offset)

    @rx.event
    def set_y_axis_offset(self, offset: str):
        self.y_axis_offset = int(offset)

# Label

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

Label is a component used to display a single label at a specific position within a chart or axis, while LabelList is a component that automatically renders a list of labels for each data point in a chart series, providing a convenient way to display multiple labels without manually positioning each one.

## Simple Example

Here's a simple example that demonstrates how you can customize the label of your axis using `rx.recharts.label`. The `value` prop represents the actual text of the label, the `position` prop specifies where the label is positioned within the axis component, and the `offset` prop is used to fine-tune the label's position.

```python demo graphing

  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,

## Label List Example

`rx.recharts.label_list` takes in a `data_key` where we define the data column to plot.

```python demo graphing

    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {

    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 5800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181

    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def label_list():

# Tooltip

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

Tooltips are the little boxes that pop up when you hover over something. Tooltips are always attached to something, like a dot on a scatter chart, or a bar on a bar chart.

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",

    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def tooltip_simple():
  return rx.recharts.composed_chart(
    rx.recharts.area(
        data_key="uv",
        stroke="#8884d8",
        fill="#8884d8"
    ), 
    rx.recharts.bar(
        data_key="amt",
        bar_size=20,
        fill="#413ea0"
    ),
    rx.recharts.line(
        data_key="pv",
        type_="monotone",
        stroke="#ff7300"
    ), 
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),

    rx.recharts.graphing_tooltip(),
    data=data,
    width = "100%",
    height = 300,
  )
```

## Custom Styling

The `rx.recharts.graphing_tooltip` component allows for customization of the tooltip's style, position, and layout. `separator` sets the separator between the data key and value. `view_box` prop defines the dimensions of the chart's viewbox while `allow_escape_view_box` determines whether the tooltip can extend beyond the viewBox horizontally (x) or vertically (y). `wrapper_style` prop allows you to style the outer container or wrapper of the tooltip. `content_style` prop allows you to style the inner content area of the tooltip. `is_animation_active` prop determines if the tooltip animation is active or not.

# Brush

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```
## Simple Example

The brush component allows us to view charts that have a large number of data points. To view and analyze them efficiently, the brush provides a slider with two handles that helps the viewer to select some range of data points to be displayed.

```python demo graphing
data = [
  { "name": '1', "uv": 300, "pv": 456 },
  { "name": '2', "uv": -145, "pv": 230 },

  { "name": '22', "uv": 164, "pv": 302 },
  { "name": '23', "uv": 316, "pv": 425 },
  { "name": '24', "uv": 131, "pv": 467 },
  { "name": '25', "uv": 291, "pv": -190 },

  { "name": '33', "uv": 205, "pv": 354 },
  { "name": '34', "uv": 70, "pv": 258 },
  { "name": '35', "uv": -25, "pv": 359 },
  { "name": '36', "uv": -59, "pv": 192 },
  { "name": '37', "uv": -63, "pv": 464 },
  { "name": '38', "uv": -91, "pv": -2 },
  { "name": '39', "uv": -66, "pv": 154 },
  { "name": '40', "uv": -50, "pv": 186 },
]

def brush_simple():
  return rx.recharts.bar_chart(
    rx.recharts.bar(
        data_key="uv",
        stroke="#8884d8",
        fill="#8884d8"
    ),
    rx.recharts.bar(
        data_key="pv",
        stroke="#82ca9d",
        fill="#82ca9d"
    ),
    rx.recharts.brush(data_key="name", height=30, stroke="#8884d8"),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(),
    data=data,
    width="100%",
    height=300,
  )
```

## Position, Size, and Range

This example showcases ways to set the Position, Size, and Range. The `gap` prop provides the spacing between stops on the brush when the graph will refresh. The `start_index` and `end_index` props defines the default range of the brush. `traveller_width` prop specifies the width of each handle ("traveller" in recharts lingo).

# Pie Chart

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion.

For a pie chart we must define an `rx.recharts.pie()` component for each set of values we wish to plot. Each `rx.recharts.pie()` component has a `data`, a `data_key` and a `name_key` which clearly states which data and which variables in our data we are tracking. In this simple example we plot `value` column as our `data_key` against the `name` column which we set as our `name_key`.
We also use the `fill` prop to set the color of the pie slices.

```python demo graphing

data01 = [
  {
    "name": "Group A",
    "value": 400
  },
  {
    "name": "Group B",
    "value": 300,
    "fill":"#AC0E08FF"
  },
  {
    "name": "Group C",
    "value": 300,
    "fill":"rgb(80,40, 190)"
  },
  {
    "name": "Group D",
    "value": 200,
    "fill":rx.color("yellow", 10)
  },
  {
    "name": "Group E",
    "value": 278,
    "fill":"purple"
  },
  {
    "name": "Group F",
    "value": 189,
    "fill":"orange"
  }
]

def pie_simple():
  return rx.recharts.pie_chart(
            rx.recharts.pie(
                data=data01,
                data_key="value",
                name_key="name",
                fill="#8884d8",
                label=True,
            ),
            width="100%",
            height=300,
        )
```

We can also add two pies on one chart by using two `rx.recharts.pie` components.

In this example `inner_radius` and `outer_radius` props are used. They define the doughnut shape of a pie chart: `inner_radius` creates the hollow center (use "0%" for a full pie), while `outer_radius` sets the overall size. The `padding_angle` prop, used on the green pie below, adds space between pie slices, enhancing visibility of individual segments.

```python demo graphing

data01 = [
  {
    "name": "Group A",
    "value": 400
  },
  {
    "name": "Group B",
    "value": 300
  },
  {
    "name": "Group C",
    "value": 300
  },
  {
    "name": "Group D",
    "value": 200
  },
  {
    "name": "Group E",
    "value": 278
  },
  {
    "name": "Group F",
    "value": 189
  }
]
data02 = [
  {
    "name": "Group A",
    "value": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Group B",
    "value": 4567
  },
  {
    "name": "Group C",
    "value": 1398
  },
  {
    "name": "Group D",
    "value": 9800
  },
  {
    "name": "Group E",
    "value": 3908
  },
  {
    "name": "Group F",
    "value": 4800
  }
]


def pie_double():
  return rx.recharts.pie_chart(
            rx.recharts.pie(
                data=data01,
                data_key="value",
                name_key="name",
                fill="#82ca9d",
                inner_radius="60%",
                padding_angle=5,
            ),
            rx.recharts.pie(
                data=data02,
                data_key="value",
                name_key="name",
                fill="#8884d8",

## Dynamic Data

Chart data tied to a State var causes the chart to automatically update when the
state changes, providing a nice way to visualize data in response to user
interface elements. View the "Data" tab to see the substate driving this
half-pie chart.

```python demo exec
from typing import Any


class PieChartState(rx.State):
    resources: list[dict[str, Any]] = [
        dict(type_="🏆", count=1),
        dict(type_="🪵", count=1),
        dict(type_="🥑", count=1),
        dict(type_="🧱", count=1),
    ]

    @rx.var(cache=True)
    def resource_types(self) -> list[str]:
        return [r["type_"] for r in self.resources]

    @rx.event
    def increment(self, type_: str):
        for resource in self.resources:
            if resource["type_"] == type_:
                resource["count"] += 1
                break

    @rx.event
    def decrement(self, type_: str):
        for resource in self.resources:
            if resource["type_"] == type_ and resource["count"] > 0:
                resource["count"] -= 1
                break


def dynamic_pie_example():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.recharts.pie_chart(
            rx.recharts.pie(
                data=PieChartState.resources,
                data_key="count",
                name_key="type_",
                cx="50%",
                cy="50%",
                start_angle=180,
                end_angle=0,
                fill="#8884d8",
                label=True,
            ),
            rx.recharts.graphing_tooltip(),
        ),
        rx.vstack(
            rx.foreach(
                PieChartState.resource_types,
                lambda type_, i: rx.hstack(
                    rx.button("-", on_click=PieChartState.decrement(type_)),
                    rx.text(type_, PieChartState.resources[i]["count"]),
                    rx.button("+", on_click=PieChartState.increment(type_)),
                ),
            ),
        ),
        width="100%",
        height="15em",
    )

# Bar Chart

```python exec
import reflex as rx
import random
from pcweb.pages.docs import library
```

A bar chart presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent.

For a bar chart we must define an `rx.recharts.bar()` component for each set of values we wish to plot. Each `rx.recharts.bar()` component has a `data_key` which clearly states which variable in our data we are tracking. In this simple example we plot `uv` as a bar against the `name` column which we set as the `data_key` in `rx.recharts.x_axis`.

## Simple Example

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 9800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181
  },
  {
    "name": "Page F",
    "uv": 2390,
    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def bar_simple():
  return rx.recharts.bar_chart(
    rx.recharts.bar(
        data_key="uv",
        stroke=rx.color("accent", 9),
        fill=rx.color("accent", 8),
    ),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(),
    data=data,
    width = "100%",
    height = 250,
  )
```

## Multiple Bars

Multiple bars can be placed on the same `bar_chart`, using multiple `rx.recharts.bar()` components.

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 9800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181
  },
  {
    "name": "Page F",
    "uv": 2390,
    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def bar_double():
  return rx.recharts.bar_chart(
    rx.recharts.bar(
        data_key="uv",
        stroke=rx.color("accent", 9),
        fill=rx.color("accent", 8),
    ),
    rx.recharts.bar(
        data_key="pv",
        stroke=rx.color("green", 9),
        fill=rx.color("green", 8),
    ),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(),
    data=data,
    width = "100%",
    height = 250,
  )
```

## Ranged Charts

You can also assign a range in the bar by assigning the data_key in the `rx.recharts.bar` to a list with two elements, i.e. here a range of two temperatures for each date.

```python demo graphing
range_data = [
  {
    "day": "05-01",
    "temperature": [
      -1,
      10
    ]
  },
  {
    "day": "05-02",
    "temperature": [
      2,
      15
    ]
  },
  {
    "day": "05-03",
    "temperature": [
      3,
      12
    ]
  },
  {
    "day": "05-04",
    "temperature": [
      4,
      12
    ]
  },
  {
    "day": "05-05",
    "temperature": [
      12,
      16
    ]
  },
  {
    "day": "05-06",
    "temperature": [
      5,
      16
    ]
  },
  {
    "day": "05-07",
    "temperature": [
      3,
      12
    ]
  },
  {
    "day": "05-08",
    "temperature": [
      0,
      8
    ]
  },
  {
    "day": "05-09",
    "temperature": [
      -3,
      5
    ]
  }
]

def bar_range():
  return rx.recharts.bar_chart(
    rx.recharts.bar(
        data_key="temperature",
        stroke=rx.color("accent", 9),
        fill=rx.color("accent", 8),
    ),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="day"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(),
    data=range_data,
    width = "100%",
    height = 250,
  )
```

## Stateful Charts

Here is an example of a bar graph with a `State`. Here we have defined a function `randomize_data`, which randomly changes the data for both graphs when the first defined `bar` is clicked on using `on_click=BarState.randomize_data`.

```python demo exec
class BarState(rx.State):
    data = data

    @rx.event
    def randomize_data(self):
        for i in range(len(self.data)):
            self.data[i]["uv"] = random.randint(0, 10000)
            self.data[i]["pv"] = random.randint(0, 10000)
            self.data[i]["amt"] = random.randint(0, 10000)

def bar_with_state():
  return rx.recharts.bar_chart(
    rx.recharts.cartesian_grid(
      stroke_dasharray="3 3",
    ),
    rx.recharts.bar(
      data_key="uv",
      stroke=rx.color("accent", 9),
      fill=rx.color("accent", 8),
    ),
    rx.recharts.bar(
      data_key="pv",
      stroke=rx.color("green", 9),
      fill=rx.color("green", 8),
    ),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(),
    rx.recharts.legend(),
    on_click=BarState.randomize_data,
    data=BarState.data,
    width = "100%",
    height = 300,
  )
```

## Example with Props

Here's an example demonstrates how to customize the appearance and layout of bars using the `bar_category_gap`, `bar_gap`, `bar_size`, and `max_bar_size` props. These props accept values in pixels to control the spacing and size of the bars.

```python demo graphing

data = [
    {'name': 'Page A', 'value': 2400},
    {'name': 'Page B', 'value': 1398},
    {'name': 'Page C', 'value': 9800},
    {'name': 'Page D', 'value': 3908},
    {'name': 'Page E', 'value': 4800},
    {'name': 'Page F', 'value': 3800},
]

def bar_features():
    return rx.recharts.bar_chart(
        rx.recharts.bar(
            data_key="value",
            fill=rx.color("accent", 8),
        ),
        rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
        rx.recharts.y_axis(),
        data=data,
        bar_category_gap="15%",
        bar_gap=6,
        bar_size=100,
        max_bar_size=40,
        width="100%",
        height=300,
    )
```

## Vertical Example

The `layout` prop allows you to set the orientation of the graph to be vertical or horizontal, it is set horizontally by default.

```md alert info
# Include margins around your graph to ensure proper spacing and enhance readability. By default, provide margins on all sides of the chart to create a visually appealing and functional representation of your data.
```

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 9800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181
  },
  {
    "name": "Page F",
    "uv": 2390,
    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def bar_vertical():
    return rx.recharts.bar_chart(
        rx.recharts.bar(
            data_key="uv",
            stroke=rx.color("accent", 8),
            fill=rx.color("accent", 3),
        ),
        rx.recharts.x_axis(type_="number"),
        rx.recharts.y_axis(data_key="name", type_="category"),
        data=data,
        layout="vertical",
        margin={
            "top": 20,
            "right": 20,
            "left": 20,
            "bottom": 20
        },
        width = "100%",
        height = 300,

    )
```

To learn how to use the `sync_id`, `stack_id`,`x_axis_id` and `y_axis_id` props check out the of the area chart [documentation]({library.graphing.charts.areachart.path}), where these props are all described with examples.

# Line Chart

```python exec
import random
from typing import Any
from pcweb.pages.docs import library
import reflex as rx
```

A line chart is a type of chart used to show information that changes over time. Line charts are created by plotting a series of several points and connecting them with a straight line.

## Simple Example

For a line chart we must define an `rx.recharts.line()` component for each set of values we wish to plot. Each `rx.recharts.line()` component has a `data_key` which clearly states which variable in our data we are tracking. In this simple example we plot `pv` and `uv` as separate lines against the `name` column which we set as the `data_key` in `rx.recharts.x_axis`.

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210

## Example with Props

Our second example uses exactly the same data as our first example, except now we add some extra features to our line graphs. We add a `type_` prop to `rx.recharts.line` to style the lines differently. In addition, we add an `rx.recharts.cartesian_grid` to get a grid in the background, an `rx.recharts.legend` to give us a legend for our graphs and an `rx.recharts.graphing_tooltip` to add a box with text that appears when you pause the mouse pointer on an element in the graph.

```python demo graphing

data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 9800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181
  },
  {
    "name": "Page F",
    "uv": 2390,
    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def line_features():
  return rx.recharts.line_chart(
    rx.recharts.line(
        data_key="pv",
        type_="monotone",
        stroke="#8884d8",),
    rx.recharts.line(
        data_key="uv",
        type_="monotone",
        stroke="#82ca9d",),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(),
    rx.recharts.cartesian_grid(stroke_dasharray="3 3"),
    rx.recharts.graphing_tooltip(),
    rx.recharts.legend(),
    data=data,
    width = "100%",
    height = 300,
  )
```

## Layout

The `layout` prop allows you to set the orientation of the graph to be vertical or horizontal. The `margin` prop defines the spacing around the graph,

```md alert info
# Include margins around your graph to ensure proper spacing and enhance readability. By default, provide margins on all sides of the chart to create a visually appealing and functional representation of your data.
```

```python demo graphing

data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,

    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def line_vertical():
    return rx.recharts.line_chart(
        rx.recharts.line(
            data_key="pv",
            stroke=rx.color("accent", 9),
        ),
        rx.recharts.line(
            data_key="uv",
            stroke=rx.color("green", 9),
        ),
        rx.recharts.x_axis(type_="number"),

        },
        data = data,
        height = 300,
        width = "100%",
    )
```

## Dynamic Data

Chart data can be modified by tying the `data` prop to a State var. Most other
props, such as `type_`, can be controlled dynamically as well. In the following
example the "Munge Data" button can be used to randomly modify the data, and the
two `select` elements change the line `type_`. Since the data and style is saved
in the per-browser-tab State, the changes will not be visible to other visitors.

```python demo exec

initial_data = data

class LineChartState(rx.State):
    data: list[dict[str, Any]] = initial_data
    pv_type: str = "monotone"
    uv_type: str = "monotone"

    @rx.event
    def set_pv_type(self, pv_type: str):
        self.pv_type = pv_type

    @rx.event
    def set_uv_type(self, uv_type: str):
        self.uv_type = uv_type

    @rx.event
    def munge_data(self):
        for row in self.data:
            row["uv"] += random.randint(-500, 500)
            row["pv"] += random.randint(-1000, 1000)

def line_dynamic():
  return rx.vstack(
    rx.recharts.line_chart(
      rx.recharts.line(
        data_key="pv",
        type_=LineChartState.pv_type,
        stroke="#8884d8",
      ),
      rx.recharts.line(
        data_key="uv",
        type_=LineChartState.uv_type,
        stroke="#82ca9d",
      ),
      rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
      rx.recharts.y_axis(),
      data=LineChartState.data,
      margin={
        "top": 20,
        "right": 20,
        "left": 20,
        "bottom": 20
      },
      width = "100%",
      height = 300,
    ),
    rx.hstack(
      rx.button("Munge Data", on_click=LineChartState.munge_data),
      rx.select(
        ["monotone", "linear", "step", "stepBefore", "stepAfter"],
        value=LineChartState.pv_type,
        on_change=LineChartState.set_pv_type
      ),
      rx.select(
          ["monotone", "linear", "step", "stepBefore", "stepAfter"],
          value=LineChartState.uv_type,
          on_change=LineChartState.set_uv_type
      ),
    ),
    width="100%",
  )
```

# Radial Bar Chart

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```
## Simple Example

This example demonstrates how to use a `radial_bar_chart` with a `radial_bar`. The `radial_bar_chart` takes in `data` and then the `radial_bar` takes in a `data_key`. A radial bar chart is a circular visualization where data categories are represented by bars extending outward from a central point, with the length of each bar proportional to its value.

```md alert info
# Fill color supports `rx.color()`, which automatically adapts to dark/light mode changes.
```

```python demo graphing
data = [
    {"name": "C", "x": 3, "fill": rx.color("cyan", 9)},
    {"name": "D", "x": 4, "fill": rx.color("blue", 9)},
    {"name": "E", "x": 5, "fill": rx.color("orange", 9)},
    {"name": "F", "x": 6, "fill": rx.color("red", 9)},
    {"name": "G", "x": 7, "fill": rx.color("gray", 9)},
    {"name": "H", "x": 8, "fill": rx.color("green", 9)},
    {"name": "I", "x": 9, "fill": rx.color("accent", 6)},
]

def radial_bar_simple():
    return rx.recharts.radial_bar_chart(
        rx.recharts.radial_bar(
            data_key="x",
            min_angle=15,
        ),
        data=data,
        width = "100%",
        height = 500,
    )
```

## Advanced Example

The `start_angle` and `end_angle` define the circular arc over which the bars are distributed, while `inner_radius` and `outer_radius` determine the radial extent of the bars from the center. 

```python demo graphing

data_radial_bar = [
    {
        "name": "18-24",
        "uv": 31.47,
        "pv": 2400,

# Radar Chart

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from typing import Any
```

A radar chart shows multivariate data of three or more quantitative variables mapped onto an axis.

## Simple Example

For a radar chart we must define an `rx.recharts.radar()` component for each set of values we wish to plot. Each `rx.recharts.radar()` component has a `data_key` which clearly states which variable in our data we are plotting. In this simple example we plot the `A` column of our data against the `subject` column which we set as the `data_key` in `rx.recharts.polar_angle_axis`.

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "subject": "Math",
    "A": 120,
    "B": 110,
    "fullMark": 150
  },
  {
    "subject": "Chinese",
    "A": 98,
    "B": 130,
    "fullMark": 150
  },
  {
    "subject": "English",
    "A": 86,
    "B": 130,
    "fullMark": 150
  },
  {
    "subject": "Geography",
    "A": 99,
    "B": 100,
    "fullMark": 150
  },
  {
    "subject": "Physics",
    "A": 85,
    "B": 90,
    "fullMark": 150
  },
  {
    "subject": "History",
    "A": 65,
    "B": 85,
    "fullMark": 150
  }
]

def radar_simple():
    return rx.recharts.radar_chart(
        rx.recharts.radar(
            data_key="A",
            stroke="#8884d8",
            fill="#8884d8",
        ),
        rx.recharts.polar_grid(),
        rx.recharts.polar_angle_axis(data_key="subject"),
        rx.recharts.polar_radius_axis(angle=90, domain=[0, 150]),
        data=data,
        width="100%",
        height=300,
    )
```

## Multiple Radars

We can also add two radars on one chart by using two `rx.recharts.radar` components.

In this plot an `inner_radius` and an `outer_radius` are set which determine the chart's size and shape. The `inner_radius` sets the distance from the center to the innermost part of the chart (creating a hollow center if greater than zero), while the `outer_radius` defines the chart's overall size by setting the distance from the center to the outermost edge of the radar plot.

```python demo graphing

data = [
  {
    "subject": "Math",
    "A": 120,
    "B": 110,
    "fullMark": 150
  },
  {
    "subject": "Chinese",
    "A": 98,
    "B": 130,
    "fullMark": 150
  },
  {
    "subject": "English",
    "A": 86,
    "B": 130,
    "fullMark": 150
  },
  {
    "subject": "Geography",
    "A": 99,
    "B": 100,
    "fullMark": 150
  },
  {
    "subject": "Physics",
    "A": 85,
    "B": 90,
    "fullMark": 150
  },
  {
    "subject": "History",
    "A": 65,
    "B": 85,
    "fullMark": 150
  }
]

def radar_multiple():
    return rx.recharts.radar_chart(
        rx.recharts.radar(
            data_key="A",
            stroke="#8884d8",
            fill="#8884d8",
        ),
        rx.recharts.radar(
            data_key="B",
            stroke="#82ca9d",
            fill="#82ca9d",
            fill_opacity=0.6,
        ),
        rx.recharts.polar_grid(),
        rx.recharts.polar_angle_axis(data_key="subject"),
        rx.recharts.polar_radius_axis(angle=90, domain=[0, 150]),
        rx.recharts.legend(),
        data=data,
        inner_radius="15%",
        outer_radius="80%",
        width="100%",
        height=300,
    )

```

## Using More Props

The `dot` prop shows points at each data vertex when true. `legend_type="line"` displays a line in the chart legend. `animation_begin=0` starts the animation immediately, `animation_duration=8000` sets an 8-second animation, and `animation_easing="ease-in"` makes the animation start slowly and speed up. These props control the chart's appearance and animation behavior.

```python demo graphing

data = [
    {
        "subject": "Math",
        "A": 120,
        "B": 110,
        "fullMark": 150
    },
    {
        "subject": "Chinese",

# Dynamic Data

Chart data tied to a State var causes the chart to automatically update when the
state changes, providing a nice way to visualize data in response to user
interface elements. View the "Data" tab to see the substate driving this
radar chart of character traits.

```python demo exec
class RadarChartState(rx.State):

        dict(trait="Dexterity", value=15),
        dict(trait="Constitution", value=15),
        dict(trait="Intelligence", value=15),
        dict(trait="Wisdom", value=15),
        dict(trait="Charisma", value=15),
    ]

    @rx.var
    def remaining_points(self) -> int:

                lambda trait_name, i: rx.hstack(
                    rx.text(trait_name, width="7em"),
                    rx.slider(
                        default_value=RadarChartState.traits[i]["value"].to(int),
                        on_change=lambda value: RadarChartState.set_trait(trait_name, value[0]),
                        width="25vw",
                    ),
                    rx.text(RadarChartState.traits[i]['value']),
                ),
            ),

# Area Chart

```python exec
import reflex as rx
import random
```

A Recharts area chart displays quantitative data using filled areas between a line connecting data points and the axis.

## Basic Example

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 9800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181
  },
  {
    "name": "Page F",
    "uv": 2390,
    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def area_simple():
  return rx.recharts.area_chart(
    rx.recharts.area(
        data_key="uv",
    ),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(),
    data=data,
    width = "100%",
    height = 250,
  )
```

## Syncing Charts

The `sync_id` prop allows you to sync two graphs. In the example, it is set to "1" for both charts, indicating that they should be synchronized. This means that any interactions (such as brushing) performed on one chart will be reflected in the other chart.

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 9800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181
  },
  {
    "name": "Page F",
    "uv": 2390,
    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def area_sync():
  return rx.vstack(
    rx.recharts.bar_chart(
      rx.recharts.graphing_tooltip(),
      rx.recharts.bar(
          data_key="uv", stroke="#8884d8", fill="#8884d8"
      ),
      rx.recharts.bar(
          data_key="pv", stroke="#82ca9d", fill="#82ca9d",
      ),
      rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
      rx.recharts.y_axis(),
      data=data,
      sync_id="1",
      width = "100%",
      height = 200,
    ),
    rx.recharts.composed_chart(
      rx.recharts.area(
          data_key="uv", stroke="#8884d8", fill="#8884d8"
      ),
      rx.recharts.line(
          data_key="pv", type_="monotone", stroke="#ff7300",
      ),

      rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
      rx.recharts.y_axis(),
      rx.recharts.graphing_tooltip(),
      rx.recharts.brush(
          data_key="name", height=30, stroke="#8884d8"
      ),
      data=data,
      sync_id="1",
      width = "100%",
      height = 250,
    ),
    width="100%",
  )
```

## Stacking Charts

The `stack_id` prop allows you to stack multiple graphs on top of each other. In the example, it is set to "1" for both charts, indicating that they should be stacked together. This means that the bars or areas of the charts will be vertically stacked, with the values of each chart contributing to the total height of the stacked areas or bars.

This is similar to the `sync_id` prop, but instead of synchronizing the interaction between the charts, it just stacks the charts on top of each other.

```python demo graphing

data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 9800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181
  },
  {
    "name": "Page F",
    "uv": 2390,
    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def area_stack():
    return rx.recharts.area_chart(
        rx.recharts.area(
            data_key="uv",
            stroke=rx.color("accent", 9),
            fill=rx.color("accent", 8),
            stack_id="1",
        ),
        rx.recharts.area(
            data_key="pv",
            stroke=rx.color("green", 9),
            fill=rx.color("green", 8),
            stack_id="1",
        ),
        rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name"),
        rx.recharts.y_axis(),
        data=data,
        stack_offset="none",
        margin={"top": 5, "right": 5, "bottom": 5, "left": 5},
        width = "100%",
        height = 300,
    )
```

## Multiple Axis

Multiple axes can be used for displaying different data series with varying scales or units on the same chart. This allows for a more comprehensive comparison and analysis of the data.

```python demo graphing

data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 9800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181
  },
  {
    "name": "Page F",
    "uv": 2390,
    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def area_multi_axis():
  return rx.recharts.area_chart(
    rx.recharts.area(
        data_key="uv", stroke="#8884d8", fill="#8884d8", x_axis_id="primary", y_axis_id="left",
    ),
    rx.recharts.area(
        data_key="pv", x_axis_id="secondary", y_axis_id="right", type_="monotone", stroke="#82ca9d", fill="#82ca9d"
    ),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name", x_axis_id="primary"),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="name", x_axis_id="secondary", orientation="top"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(data_key="uv", y_axis_id="left"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(data_key="pv", y_axis_id="right", orientation="right"),
    rx.recharts.graphing_tooltip(),
    rx.recharts.legend(),
    data=data,
    width = "100%",
    height = 300,
  )
```

## Layout

Use the `layout` prop to set the orientation to either `"horizontal"` (default) or `"vertical"`.

```md alert info
# Include margins around your graph to ensure proper spacing and enhance readability. By default, provide margins on all sides of the chart to create a visually appealing and functional representation of your data.
```

```python demo graphing

data = [
  {
    "name": "Page A",
    "uv": 4000,
    "pv": 2400,
    "amt": 2400
  },
  {
    "name": "Page B",
    "uv": 3000,
    "pv": 1398,
    "amt": 2210
  },
  {
    "name": "Page C",
    "uv": 2000,
    "pv": 9800,
    "amt": 2290
  },
  {
    "name": "Page D",
    "uv": 2780,
    "pv": 3908,
    "amt": 2000
  },
  {
    "name": "Page E",
    "uv": 1890,
    "pv": 4800,
    "amt": 2181
  },
  {
    "name": "Page F",
    "uv": 2390,
    "pv": 3800,
    "amt": 2500
  },
  {
    "name": "Page G",
    "uv": 3490,
    "pv": 4300,
    "amt": 2100
  }
]

def area_vertical():
    return rx.recharts.area_chart(
        rx.recharts.area(
            data_key="uv",
            stroke=rx.color("accent", 8),
            fill=rx.color("accent", 3),
        ),
        rx.recharts.x_axis(type_="number"),
        rx.recharts.y_axis(data_key="name", type_="category"),
        data=data,
        layout="vertical",
        height = 300,
        width = "100%",
    )
```

## Stateful Example

Here is an example of an area graph with a `State`. Here we have defined a function `randomize_data`, which randomly changes the data for both graphs when the first defined `area` is clicked on using `on_click=AreaState.randomize_data`.

```python demo exec
class AreaState(rx.State):
    data = data
    curve_type = ""

    @rx.event
    def randomize_data(self):
        for i in range(len(self.data)):
            self.data[i]["uv"] = random.randint(0, 10000)
            self.data[i]["pv"] = random.randint(0, 10000)
            self.data[i]["amt"] = random.randint(0, 10000)

    def change_curve_type(self, type_input):
        self.curve_type = type_input

def area_stateful():
    return rx.vstack(
      rx.hstack(
        rx.text("Curve Type:"),
        rx.select(
          [
            'basis',
            'natural',
            'step'
          ],
          on_change = AreaState.change_curve_type,
          default_value = 'basis',
        ),
      ),
      rx.recharts.area_chart(
        rx.recharts.area(
            data_key="uv",
            on_click=AreaState.randomize_data,
            type_ = AreaState.curve_type,
        ),
        rx.recharts.area(
            data_key="pv",
            stroke="#82ca9d",
            fill="#82ca9d",
            on_click=AreaState.randomize_data,
            type_ = AreaState.curve_type,
        ),
        rx.recharts.x_axis(
            data_key="name",
        ),
        rx.recharts.y_axis(),
        rx.recharts.legend(),
        rx.recharts.cartesian_grid(),
        data=AreaState.data,
        width = "100%",
        height=400,
      ),
      width="100%",
    )
```

# Composed Chart

A `composed_chart` is a higher-level component chart that is composed of multiple charts, where other charts are the children of the `composed_chart`. The charts are placed on top of each other in the order they are provided in the `composed_chart` function.

# Scatter Chart

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb.templates.docpage import docgraphing
from pcweb.pages.docs import library
```

A scatter chart always has two value axes to show one set of numerical data along a horizontal (value) axis and another set of numerical values along a vertical (value) axis. The chart displays points at the intersection of an x and y numerical value, combining these values into single data points.

## Simple Example

For a scatter chart we must define an `rx.recharts.scatter()` component for each set of values we wish to plot. Each `rx.recharts.scatter()` component has a `data` prop which clearly states which data source we plot. We also must define `rx.recharts.x_axis()` and `rx.recharts.y_axis()` so that the graph knows what data to plot on each axis.

```python demo graphing
data01 = [
  {
    "x": 100,
    "y": 200,
    "z": 200
  },
  {
    "x": 120,
    "y": 100,
    "z": 260
  },
  {
    "x": 170,
    "y": 300,
    "z": 400
  },
  {
    "x": 170,
    "y": 250,
    "z": 280
  },
  {
    "x": 150,
    "y": 400,
    "z": 500
  },
  {
    "x": 110,
    "y": 280,
    "z": 200
  }
]

def scatter_simple():
  return rx.recharts.scatter_chart(
    rx.recharts.scatter(
        data=data01,
        fill="#8884d8",),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="x", type_="number"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(data_key="y"),
    width = "100%",
    height = 300,
  )
```

## Multiple Scatters

We can also add two scatters on one chart by using two `rx.recharts.scatter()` components, and we can define an `rx.recharts.z_axis()` which represents a third column of data and is represented by the size of the dots in the scatter plot.

```python demo graphing
data01 = [
  {
    "x": 100,
    "y": 200,
    "z": 200
  },
  {
    "x": 120,
    "y": 100,
    "z": 260
  },
  {
    "x": 170,
    "y": 300,
    "z": 400
  },
  {
    "x": 170,
    "y": 250,
    "z": 280
  },
  {
    "x": 150,
    "y": 350,
    "z": 500
  },
  {
    "x": 110,
    "y": 280,
    "z": 200
  }
]

data02 = [
  {
    "x": 200,
    "y": 260,
    "z": 240
  },
  {
    "x": 240,
    "y": 290,
    "z": 220
  },
  {
    "x": 190,
    "y": 290,
    "z": 250
  },
  {
    "x": 198,
    "y": 250,
    "z": 210
  },
  {
    "x": 180,
    "y": 280,
    "z": 260
  },
  {
    "x": 210,
    "y": 220,
    "z": 230
  }
]

def scatter_double():
  return rx.recharts.scatter_chart(
    rx.recharts.scatter(
        data=data01,
        fill="#8884d8",
        name="A"
      ),
    rx.recharts.scatter(
        data=data02,
        fill="#82ca9d",
        name="B"
      ),
    rx.recharts.cartesian_grid(stroke_dasharray="3 3"),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="x", type_="number"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(data_key="y"),
    rx.recharts.z_axis(data_key="z", range=[60, 400], name="score"),
    rx.recharts.legend(),
    rx.recharts.graphing_tooltip(),
    width="100%",

## Dynamic Data

Chart data tied to a State var causes the chart to automatically update when the
state changes, providing a nice way to visualize data in response to user
interface elements. View the "Data" tab to see the substate driving this
calculation of iterations in the Collatz Conjecture for a given starting number.
Enter a starting number in the box below the chart to recalculate.

```python demo exec
class ScatterChartState(rx.State):
    data: list[dict[str, int]] = []

    @rx.event
    def compute_collatz(self, form_data: dict) -> int:
        n = int(form_data.get("start") or 1)
        yield rx.set_value("start", "")
        self.data = []
        for ix in range(400):
            self.data.append({"x": ix, "y": n})
            if n == 1:
                break
            if n % 2 == 0:
                n = n // 2
            else:
                n = 3 * n + 1


def scatter_dynamic():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.recharts.scatter_chart(
            rx.recharts.scatter(
                data=ScatterChartState.data,
                fill="#8884d8",
            ),
            rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="x", type_="number"),
            rx.recharts.y_axis(data_key="y", type_="number"),
        ),
        rx.form.root(
            rx.input(placeholder="Enter a number", id="start"),
            rx.button("Compute", type="submit"),

# Funnel Chart

A funnel chart is a graphical representation used to visualize how data moves through a process. In a funnel chart, the dependent variable’s value diminishes in the subsequent stages of the process. It can be used to demonstrate the flow of users through a business or sales process.

## Simple Example

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "value": 100,
    "name": "Sent",
    "fill": "#8884d8"
  },
  {
    "value": 80,
    "name": "Viewed",
    "fill": "#83a6ed"
  },
  {
    "value": 50,
    "name": "Clicked",
    "fill": "#8dd1e1"
  },
  {
    "value": 40,
    "name": "Add to Cart",
    "fill": "#82ca9d"
  },
  {
    "value": 26,
    "name": "Purchased",
    "fill": "#a4de6c"
  }
]

def funnel_simple():
    return rx.recharts.funnel_chart(
        rx.recharts.funnel(
            rx.recharts.label_list(
                position="right",
                data_key="name",
                fill="#000",
                stroke="none",
            ),
            data_key="value",
            data=data,
        ),
        width="100%",
        height=250,
    )
```

## Event Triggers

Funnel chart supports `on_click`, `on_mouse_enter`, `on_mouse_leave` and `on_mouse_move` event triggers, allows you to interact with the funnel chart and perform specific actions based on user interactions.

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "value": 100,
    "name": "Sent",
    "fill": "#8884d8"
  },
  {
    "value": 80,
    "name": "Viewed",
    "fill": "#83a6ed"
  },
  {
    "value": 50,
    "name": "Clicked",
    "fill": "#8dd1e1"
  },
  {
    "value": 40,
    "name": "Add to Cart",
    "fill": "#82ca9d"
  },
  {
    "value": 26,
    "name": "Purchased",
    "fill": "#a4de6c"
  }
]

def funnel_events():
    return rx.recharts.funnel_chart(
        rx.recharts.funnel(
            rx.recharts.label_list(
                position="right",
                data_key="name",
                fill="#000",
                stroke="none",
            ),
            data_key="value",
            data=data,
        ),
        on_click=rx.toast("Clicked on funnel chart"),
        on_mouse_enter=rx.toast("Mouse entered"),
        on_mouse_leave=rx.toast("Mouse left"),
        width="100%",
        height=250,
    )
```

## Dynamic Data

Here is an example of a funnel chart with a `State`. Here we have defined a function `randomize_data`, which randomly changes the data when the graph is clicked on using `on_click=FunnelState.randomize_data`.

```python exec
data = [
  {
    "value": 100,
    "name": "Sent",
    "fill": "#8884d8"
  },
  {
    "value": 80,
    "name": "Viewed",
    "fill": "#83a6ed"
  },
  {
    "value": 50,
    "name": "Clicked",
    "fill": "#8dd1e1"
  },
  {
    "value": 40,
    "name": "Add to Cart",
    "fill": "#82ca9d"
  },
  {
    "value": 26,
    "name": "Purchased",
    "fill": "#a4de6c"
  }
]
```

```python demo exec
class FunnelState(rx.State):
    data = data

    @rx.event
    def randomize_data(self):
        self.data[0]["value"] = 100
        for i in range(len(self.data) - 1):
            self.data[i + 1]["value"] = self.data[i][
                "value"
            ] - random.randint(0, 20)


def funnel_state():
  return rx.recharts.funnel_chart(
    rx.recharts.funnel(
      rx.recharts.label_list(
        position="right",
        data_key="name",
        fill="#000",
        stroke="none",
      ),
      data_key="value",
      data=FunnelState.data,
      on_click=FunnelState.randomize_data,
    ),
    rx.recharts.graphing_tooltip(),
    width="100%",
    height=250,
  )
```

## Changing the Chart Animation

The `is_animation_active` prop can be used to turn off the animation, but defaults to `True`. `animation_begin` sets the delay before animation starts, `animation_duration` determines how long the animation lasts, and `animation_easing` defines the speed curve of the animation for smooth transitions.

```python demo graphing
data = [
        {"name": "Visits", "value": 5000, "fill": "#8884d8"},
        {"name": "Cart", "value": 3000, "fill": "#83a6ed"},
        {"name": "Checkout", "value": 2500, "fill": "#8dd1e1"},
        {"name": "Purchase", "value": 1000, "fill": "#82ca9d"},
    ]

def funnel_animation():
    return rx.recharts.funnel_chart(
        rx.recharts.funnel(
            data_key="value",
            data=data,
            animation_begin=300,
            animation_duration=9000,
            animation_easing="ease-in-out",
        ),
        rx.recharts.graphing_tooltip(),
        rx.recharts.legend(),
        width="100%",
        height=300,
    )
```

    - rx.recharts.ErrorBar
---

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Error Bar

An error bar is a graphical representation of the uncertainty or variability of a data point in a chart, depicted as a line extending from the data point parallel to one of the axes. The `data_key`, `width`, `stroke_width`, `stroke`, and `direction` props can be used to customize the appearance and behavior of the error bars, specifying the data source, dimensions, color, and orientation of the error bars.

```python demo graphing
data = [
  {
    "x": 45,
    "y": 100,
    "z": 150,
    "errorY": [
      30,

    ],
    "errorX": 5
  },

    "z": 200,
    "errorY": 21,
    "errorX": [
      5,
      6
    ]
  }
]

def error():

# Plotly

```python exec
import reflex as rx
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
```

Plotly is a graphing library that can be used to create interactive graphs. Use the rx.plotly component to wrap Plotly as a component for use in your web page. Checkout [Plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/) for more information.

```md alert info
# When integrating Plotly graphs into your UI code, note that the method for displaying the graph differs from a regular Python script. Instead of using `fig.show()`, use `rx.plotly(data=fig)` within your UI code to ensure the graph is properly rendered and displayed within the user interface
```

## Basic Example

Let's create a line graph of life expectancy in Canada.

```python demo exec
import plotly.express as px

df = px.data.gapminder().query("country=='Canada'")
fig = px.line(df, x="year", y="lifeExp", title='Life expectancy in Canada')

def line_chart():
    return rx.center(
        rx.plotly(data=fig),
    )
```

## 3D graphing example

Let's create a 3D surface plot of Mount Bruno. This is a slightly more complicated example, but it wraps in Reflex using the same method. In fact, you can wrap any figure using the same approach.

```python demo exec
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import pandas as pd

# Read data from a csv
z_data = pd.read_csv('data/mt_bruno_elevation.csv')

fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Surface(z=z_data.values)])
fig.update_traces(contours_z=dict(show=True, usecolormap=True,
                                  highlightcolor="limegreen", project_z=True))
fig.update_layout(
    scene_camera_eye=dict(x=1.87, y=0.88, z=-0.64),
    margin=dict(l=65, r=50, b=65, t=90)
)

def mountain_surface():
    return rx.center(
        rx.plotly(data=fig),
    )
```

📊 **Dataset source:** [mt_bruno_elevation.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/api_docs/mt_bruno_elevation.csv)

## Plot as State Var

If the figure is set as a state var, it can be updated during run time.

```python demo exec
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import pandas as pd

class PlotlyState(rx.State):
    df: pd.DataFrame
    figure: go.Figure = px.line()

    @rx.event
    def create_figure(self):
        self.df = px.data.gapminder().query("country=='Canada'")
        self.figure = px.line(
            self.df,
            x="year",
            y="lifeExp",
            title="Life expectancy in Canada",
        )

    @rx.event
    def set_selected_country(self, country):
        self.df = px.data.gapminder().query(f"country=='{country}'")
        self.figure = px.line(
            self.df,
            x="year",
            y="lifeExp",
            title=f"Life expectancy in {country}",
        )



def line_chart_with_state():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.select(
            ['China', 'France', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Canada'],
            default_value="Canada",
            on_change=PlotlyState.set_selected_country,
        ),
        rx.plotly(
            data=PlotlyState.figure,
            on_mount=PlotlyState.create_figure,
        ),
    )
```

## Adding Styles and Layouts

Use `update_layout()` method to update the layout of your chart. Checkout [Plotly Layouts](https://plotly.com/python/reference/layout/) for all layouts props.

```md alert info
Note that the width and height props are not recommended to ensure the plot remains size responsive to its container. The size of plot will be determined by it's outer container.
```

```python demo exec
df = px.data.gapminder().query("country=='Canada'")
fig_1 = px.line(
    df,
    x="year",
    y="lifeExp",
    title="Life expectancy in Canada",
)
fig_1.update_layout(
    title_x=0.5,
    plot_bgcolor="#c3d7f7",
    paper_bgcolor="rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.1)",
    showlegend=True,
    title_font_family="Open Sans",
    title_font_size=25,
)

def add_styles():
    return rx.center(
        rx.plotly(data=fig_1),
        width="100%",
        height="100%",
    )
```

# Pyplot

Pyplot (`reflex-pyplot`) is a graphing library that wraps Matplotlib. Use the `pyplot` component to display any Matplotlib plot in your app. Check out [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for more information.

## Installation

Install the `reflex-pyplot` package using pip.

```bash
pip install reflex-pyplot
```

## Basic Example

To display a Matplotlib plot in your app, you can use the `pyplot` component. Pass in the figure you created with Matplotlib to the `pyplot` component as a child.

```python demo exec
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import reflex as rx
from reflex_pyplot import pyplot
import numpy as np

def create_contour_plot():
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-3, 3, 256), np.linspace(-3, 3, 256))
    Z = (1 - X/2 + X**5 + Y**3) * np.exp(-X**2 - Y**2)
    levels = np.linspace(Z.min(), Z.max(), 7)

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.contourf(X, Y, Z, levels=levels)
    plt.close(fig)
    return fig

def pyplot_simple_example():
    return rx.card(
            pyplot(create_contour_plot(), width="100%", height="400px"),
            bg_color='#ffffff',
            width="100%",
        )
```

```md alert info
# You must close the figure after creating

Not closing the figure could cause memory issues.
```

## Stateful Example

Lets create a scatter plot of random data. We'll also allow the user to randomize the data and change the number of points.

In this example, we'll use a `color_mode_cond` to display the plot in both light and dark mode. We need to do this manually here because the colors are determined by the matplotlib chart and not the theme.

```python demo exec
import random
from typing import Literal
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import reflex as rx
from reflex_pyplot import pyplot
import numpy as np


def create_plot(theme: str, plot_data: tuple, scale: list):
    bg_color, text_color = ('#1e1e1e', 'white') if theme == 'dark' else ('white', 'black')
    grid_color = '#555555' if theme == 'dark' else '#cccccc'

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(facecolor=bg_color)
    ax.set_facecolor(bg_color)

    for (x, y), color in zip(plot_data, ["#4e79a7", "#f28e2b"]):
        ax.scatter(x, y, c=color, s=scale, label=color, alpha=0.6, edgecolors="none")

    ax.legend(loc="upper right", facecolor=bg_color, edgecolor='none', labelcolor=text_color)
    ax.grid(True, color=grid_color)
    ax.tick_params(colors=text_color)
    for spine in ax.spines.values():
        spine.set_edgecolor(text_color)

    for item in [ax.xaxis.label, ax.yaxis.label, ax.title]:
        item.set_color(text_color)
    plt.close(fig)

    return fig

class PyplotState(rx.State):
    num_points: int = 25
    plot_data: tuple = tuple(np.random.rand(2, 25) for _ in range(2))
    scale: list = [random.uniform(0, 100) for _ in range(25)]

    @rx.event(temporal=True, throttle=500)

                        on_click=PyplotState.randomize,
                    ),
                    rx.text("Number of Points:"),

# Chaining events

## Calling Event Handlers From Event Handlers

You can call other event handlers from event handlers to keep your code modular. Just use the `self.call_handler` syntax to run another event handler. As always, you can yield within your function to send incremental updates to the frontend.

```python demo exec id=call-handler
import asyncio

class CallHandlerState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0
    progress: int = 0

    @rx.event
    async def run(self):
        # Reset the count.
        self.set_progress(0)
        yield

        # Count to 10 while showing progress.
        for i in range(10):
            # Wait and increment.
            await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
            self.count += 1

            # Update the progress.
            self.set_progress(i + 1)

            # Yield to send the update.
            yield


def call_handler_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.badge(CallHandlerState.count, font_size="1.5em", color_scheme="green"),
        rx.progress(value=CallHandlerState.progress, max=10, width="100%"),
        rx.button("Run", on_click=CallHandlerState.run),
    )
```

## Returning Events From Event Handlers

So far, we have only seen events that are triggered by components. However, an event handler can also return events.

In Reflex, event handlers run synchronously, so only one event handler can run at a time, and the events in the queue will be blocked until the current event handler finishes.The difference between returning an event and calling an event handler is that returning an event will send the event to the frontend and unblock the queue.

```md alert info
# Be sure to use the class name `State` (or any substate) rather than `self` when returning events.
```

Try entering an integer in the input below then clicking out.

```python demo exec id=collatz
class CollatzState(rx.State):
    count: int = 1

    @rx.event
    def start_collatz(self, count: str):
        """Run the collatz conjecture on the given number."""
        self.count = abs(int(count if count else 1))
        return CollatzState.run_step

    @rx.event
    async def run_step(self):
        """Run a single step of the collatz conjecture."""

        while self.count > 1:

            await asyncio.sleep(0.5)

            if self.count % 2 == 0:
                # If the number is even, divide by 2.
                self.count //= 2
            else:
                # If the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.
                self.count = self.count * 3 + 1
            yield


def collatz_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.badge(CollatzState.count, font_size="1.5em", color_scheme="green"),
        rx.input(on_blur=CollatzState.start_collatz),
    )

```

In this example, we run the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) on a number entered by the user.

When the `on_blur` event is triggered, the event handler `start_collatz` is called. It sets the initial count, then calls `run_step` which runs until the count reaches `1`.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
import datetime
```

# Event Actions

In Reflex, an event action is a special behavior that occurs during or after
processing an event on the frontend.

Event actions can modify how the browser handles DOM events or throttle and
debounce events before they are processed by the backend.

An event action is specified by accessing attributes and methods present on all
EventHandlers and EventSpecs.

## DOM Event Propagation

_Added in v0.3.2_

### prevent_default

The `.prevent_default` action prevents the default behavior of the browser for
the action. This action can be added to any existing event, or it can be used on its own by
specifying `rx.prevent_default` as an event handler.

A common use case for this is to prevent navigation when clicking a link.

```python demo
rx.link("This Link Does Nothing", href="https://reflex.dev/", on_click=rx.prevent_default)
```

```python demo exec
class LinkPreventDefaultState(rx.State):
    status: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def toggle_status(self):
        self.status = not self.status

def prevent_default_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(f"The value is {LinkPreventDefaultState.status}"),
        rx.link(
            "Toggle Value",
            href="https://reflex.dev/",
            on_click=LinkPreventDefaultState.toggle_status.prevent_default,
        ),
    )
```

### stop_propagation

The `.stop_propagation` action stops the event from propagating to parent elements.

This action is often used when a clickable element contains nested buttons that
should not trigger the parent element's click event.

In the following example, the first button uses `.stop_propagation` to prevent
the click event from propagating to the outer vstack. The second button does not
use `.stop_propagation`, so the click event will also be handled by the on_click
attached to the outer vstack.

```python demo exec
class StopPropagationState(rx.State):
    where_clicked: list[str] = []

    @rx.event
    def handle_click(self, where: str):
        self.where_clicked.append(where)

    @rx.event
    def handle_reset(self):
        self.where_clicked = []

def stop_propagation_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.button(
            "btn1 - Stop Propagation",
            on_click=StopPropagationState.handle_click("btn1").stop_propagation,
        ),
        rx.button(
            "btn2 - Normal Propagation",
            on_click=StopPropagationState.handle_click("btn2"),
        ),
        rx.foreach(StopPropagationState.where_clicked, rx.text),
        rx.button(
            "Reset",
            on_click=StopPropagationState.handle_reset.stop_propagation,
        ),
        padding="2em",
        border=f"1px dashed {rx.color('accent', 5)}",
        on_click=StopPropagationState.handle_click("outer")
    )
```

## Throttling and Debounce

_Added in v0.5.0_

For events that are fired frequently, it can be useful to throttle or debounce
them to avoid network latency and improve performance. These actions both take a
single argument which specifies the delay time in milliseconds.

### throttle

The `.throttle` action limits the number of times an event is processed within a
a given time period. It is useful for `on_scroll` and `on_mouse_move` events which are
fired very frequently, causing lag when handling them in the backend.

```md alert warning
# Throttled events are discarded.

There is no eventual delivery of any event that is triggered while the throttle
period is active. Throttle is not appropriate for events when the final payload
contains data that must be processed, like `on_change`.
```

In the following example, the `on_scroll` event is throttled to only fire every half second.

```python demo exec
class ThrottleState(rx.State):
    last_scroll: datetime.datetime | None

    @rx.event
    def handle_scroll(self):
        self.last_scroll = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)

def scroll_box():
    return rx.scroll_area(
        rx.heading("Scroll Me"),
        *[rx.text(f"Item {i}") for i in range(100)],
        height="75px",
        width="50%",
        border=f"1px solid {rx.color('accent', 5)}",
        on_scroll=ThrottleState.handle_scroll.throttle(500),
    )

def throttle_example():
    return (
        scroll_box(),
        rx.text(
            f"Last Scroll Event: ",
            rx.moment(ThrottleState.last_scroll, format="HH:mm:ss.SSS"),
        ),
    )
```

```md alert info
# Event Actions are Chainable

Event actions can be chained together to create more complex event handling
behavior. For example, you can throttle an event and prevent its default
behavior in the same event handler: `on_click=MyState.handle_click.throttle(500).prevent_default`.
```

### debounce

The `.debounce` action delays the processing of an event until the specified
timeout occurs. If another event is triggered during the timeout, the timer is
reset and the original event is discarded.

Debounce is useful for handling the final result of a series of events, such as
moving a slider.

```md alert warning
# Debounced events are discarded.

When a new event is triggered during the debounce period, the original event is
discarded. Debounce is not appropriate for events where each payload contains
unique data that must be processed, like `on_key_down`.
```

In the following example, the slider's `on_change` handler, `update_value`, is
only triggered on the backend when the slider value has not changed for half a
second.

```python demo exec
class DebounceState(rx.State):
    settled_value: int = 50

    @rx.event
    def update_value(self, value: list[int | float]):
        self.settled_value = value[0]


def debounced_slider():
    return rx.slider(
        key=rx.State.router.session.session_id,
        default_value=[DebounceState.settled_value],
        on_change=DebounceState.update_value.debounce(500),
        width="100%",
    )

def debounce_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        debounced_slider(),
        rx.text(f"Settled Value: {DebounceState.settled_value}"),
    )
```

```md alert info
# Why set key on the slider?

Setting `key` to the `session_id` with a dynamic `default_value` ensures that
when the page is refreshed, the component will be re-rendered to reflect the
updated default_value from the state.

Without the `key` set, the slider would always display the original
`settled_value` after a page reload, instead of its current value.
```

## Temporal Events

_Added in [v0.6.6](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex/releases/tag/v0.6.6)_

### temporal

The `.temporal` action prevents events from being queued when the backend is down.
This is useful for non-critical events where you do not want them to pile up if there is
a temporary connection issue.

```md alert warning
# Temporal events are discarded when the backend is down.

When the backend is unavailable, events with the `.temporal` action will be
discarded rather than queued for later processing. Only use this for events
where it is acceptable to lose some interactions during connection issues.
```

In the following example, the `rx.moment` component with `interval` and `on_change` uses `.temporal` to
prevent periodic updates from being queued when the backend is down:

```python demo exec
class TemporalState(rx.State):
    current_time: str = ""

    @rx.event
    def update_time(self):
        self.current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")

def temporal_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading("Current Time:"),
        rx.heading(TemporalState.current_time),
        rx.moment(
            interval=1000,
            on_change=TemporalState.update_time.temporal,
        ),
        rx.text("Time updates will not be queued if the backend is down."),
    )
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx

from pcweb.pages.docs import api_reference
```

# Special Events

Reflex also has built-in special events can be found in the [reference]({api_reference.special_events.path}).

For example, an event handler can trigger an alert on the browser.

```python demo exec
class SpecialEventsState(rx.State):
    @rx.event
    def alert(self):
        return rx.window_alert("Hello World!")

def special_events_example():
    return rx.button("Alert", on_click=SpecialEventsState.alert)
```

Special events can also be triggered directly in the UI by attaching them to an event trigger.

```python
def special_events_example():
    return rx.button("Alert", on_click=rx.window_alert("Hello World!"))
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Event Arguments

The event handler signature needs to match the event trigger definition argument count. If the event handler takes two arguments, the event trigger must be able to provide two arguments.

Here is a simple example:

```python demo exec

class EventArgStateSlider(rx.State):
    value: int = 50

    @rx.event
    def set_end(self, value: list[int | float]):
        self.value = value[0]


def slider_max_min_step():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(EventArgStateSlider.value),
        rx.slider(
            default_value=40,
            on_value_commit=EventArgStateSlider.set_end,
        ),
        width="100%",
    )

```

The event trigger here is `on_value_commit` and it is called when the value changes at the end of an interaction. This event trigger passes one argument, which is the value of the slider. The event handler which is triggered by the event trigger must therefore take one argument, which is `value` here.

Here is a form example:

```python demo exec

class EventArgState(rx.State):
    form_data: dict = {}

    @rx.event
    def handle_submit(self, form_data: dict):
        """Handle the form submit."""
        self.form_data = form_data


def event_arg_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.form(
            rx.vstack(
                rx.input(
                    placeholder="Name",
                    name="name",
                ),
                rx.checkbox("Checked", name="check"),
                rx.button("Submit", type="submit"),
            ),
            on_submit=EventArgState.handle_submit,
            reset_on_submit=True,
        ),
        rx.divider(),
        rx.heading("Results"),
        rx.text(EventArgState.form_data.to_string()),
    )
```

In this example the event trigger is the `on_submit` event of the form. The event handler is `handle_submit`. The `on_submit` event trigger passes one argument, the form data as a dictionary, to the `handle_submit` event handler. The `handle_submit` event handler must take one argument because the `on_submit` event trigger passes one argument.

When the number of args accepted by an EventHandler differs from that provided by the event trigger, an `EventHandlerArgMismatch` error will be raised.

## Pass Additional Arguments to Event Handlers

In some use cases, you want to pass additional arguments to your event handlers. To do this you can bind an event trigger to a lambda, which can call your event handler with the arguments you want.

Try typing a color in an input below and clicking away from it to change the color of the input.

```python demo exec
class ArgState(rx.State):
    colors: list[str] = ["rgba(245,168,152)", "MediumSeaGreen", "#DEADE3"]

    @rx.event
    def change_color(self, color: str, index: int):
        self.colors[index] = color

def event_arguments_example():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.input(default_value=ArgState.colors[0], on_blur=lambda c: ArgState.change_color(c, 0), bg=ArgState.colors[0]),
        rx.input(default_value=ArgState.colors[1], on_blur=lambda c: ArgState.change_color(c, 1), bg=ArgState.colors[1]),
        rx.input(default_value=ArgState.colors[2], on_blur=lambda c: ArgState.change_color(c, 2), bg=ArgState.colors[2]),
    )

```

In this case, in we want to pass two arguments to the event handler `change_color`, the color and the index of the color to change.

The `on_blur` event trigger passes the text of the input as an argument to the lambda, and the lambda calls the `change_color` event handler with the text and the index of the input.

When the number of args accepted by a lambda differs from that provided by the event trigger, an `EventFnArgMismatch` error will be raised.

```md alert warning
# Event Handler Parameters should provide type annotations.

Like state vars, be sure to provide the right type annotations for the parameters in an event handler.
```

## Events with Partial Arguments (Advanced)

_Added in v0.5.0_

Event arguments in Reflex are passed positionally. Any additional arguments not
passed to an EventHandler will be filled in by the event trigger when it is
fired.

The following two code samples are equivalent:

```python
# Use a lambda to pass event trigger args to the EventHandler.
rx.text(on_blur=lambda v: MyState.handle_update("field1", v))

# Create a partial that passes event trigger args for any args not provided to the EventHandler.
rx.text(on_blur=MyState.handle_update("field1"))
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx

```

# Yielding Updates

A regular event handler will send a `StateUpdate` when it has finished running. This works fine for basic event, but sometimes we need more complex logic. To update the UI multiple times in an event handler, we can `yield` when we want to send an update.

To do so, we can use the Python keyword `yield`. For every yield inside the function, a `StateUpdate` will be sent to the frontend with the changes up to this point in the execution of the event handler.

This example below shows how to yield 100 updates to the UI.

```python demo exec

class MultiUpdateState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0

    @rx.event
    def timed_update(self):
        for i in range(100):
            self.count += 1
            yield


def multi_update():
    return rx.vstack(
    rx.text(MultiUpdateState.count),
    rx.button("Start", on_click=MultiUpdateState.timed_update)
)

```

Here is another example of yielding multiple updates with a loading icon.

```python demo exec

import asyncio

class ProgressExampleState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0
    show_progress: bool = False

    @rx.event
    async def increment(self):
        self.show_progress = True
        yield
        # Think really hard.
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        self.count += 1
        self.show_progress = False

def progress_example():
    return rx.button(
        ProgressExampleState.count,
        on_click=ProgressExampleState.increment,
        loading=ProgressExampleState.show_progress,
    )

```

```md video https://youtube.com/embed/ITOZkzjtjUA?start=6463&end=6835
# Video: Asyncio with Yield
```

## Yielding Other Events

Events can also yield other events. This is useful when you want to chain events together. To do this, you can yield the event handler function itself.

```md alert
# Reference other Event Handler via class

When chaining another event handler with `yield`, access it via the state class, not `self`.
```

```python demo exec

import asyncio

class YieldEventsState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0
    show_progress: bool = False

    @rx.event
    async def add_five(self):
        self.show_progress = True
        yield
        # Think really hard.
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        self.count += 5
        self.show_progress = False

    @rx.event
    async def increment(self):
        yield YieldEventsState.add_five
        yield YieldEventsState.add_five
        yield YieldEventsState.add_five


def multiple_yield_example():
    return rx.button(
        YieldEventsState.count,
        on_click=YieldEventsState.increment,
        loading=YieldEventsState.show_progress,
    )

```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Decentralized Event Handlers

## Overview

Decentralized event handlers allow you to define event handlers outside of state classes, providing more flexible code organization. This feature was introduced in Reflex v0.7.10 and enables a more modular approach to event handling.

With decentralized event handlers, you can:
- Organize event handlers by feature rather than by state class
- Separate UI logic from state management
- Create more maintainable and scalable applications

## Basic Usage

To create a decentralized event handler, use the `@rx.event` decorator on a function that takes a state instance as its first parameter:

```python demo exec
import reflex as rx

class MyState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0

@rx.event
def increment(state: MyState, amount: int):
    state.count += amount

def decentralized_event_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(f"Count: {MyState.count}"),
        rx.hstack(
            rx.button("Increment by 1", on_click=increment(1)),
            rx.button("Increment by 5", on_click=increment(5)),
            rx.button("Increment by 10", on_click=increment(10)),
        ),
        spacing="4",
        align="center",
    )
```

In this example:
1. We define a `MyState` class with a `count` variable
2. We create a decentralized event handler `increment` that takes a `MyState` instance as its first parameter
3. We use the event handler in buttons, passing different amounts to increment by

## Compared to Traditional Event Handlers

Here's a comparison between traditional event handlers defined within state classes and decentralized event handlers:

```python box
# Traditional event handler within a state class
class TraditionalState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0

    @rx.event
    def increment(self, amount: int = 1):
        self.count += amount

# Usage in components
rx.button("Increment", on_click=TraditionalState.increment(5))

# Decentralized event handler outside the state class
class DecentralizedState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0

@rx.event
def increment(state: DecentralizedState, amount: int = 1):
    state.count += amount

# Usage in components
rx.button("Increment", on_click=increment(5))
```

Key differences:
- Traditional event handlers use `self` to reference the state instance
- Decentralized event handlers explicitly take a state instance as the first parameter
- Both approaches use the same syntax for triggering events in components
- Both can be decorated with `@rx.event` respectively

## Best Practices

### When to Use Decentralized Event Handlers

Decentralized event handlers are particularly useful in these scenarios:

1. **Large applications** with many event handlers that benefit from better organization
2. **Feature-based organization** where you want to group related event handlers together
3. **Separation of concerns** when you want to keep state definitions clean and focused

### Type Annotations

Always use proper type annotations for your state parameter and any additional parameters:

```python box
@rx.event
def update_user(state: UserState, name: str, age: int):
    state.name = name
    state.age = age
```

### Naming Conventions

Follow these naming conventions for clarity:

1. Use descriptive names that indicate the action being performed
2. Use the state class name as the type annotation for the first parameter
3. Name the state parameter consistently across your codebase (e.g., always use `state` or the first letter of the state class)

### Organization

Consider these approaches for organizing decentralized event handlers:

1. Group related event handlers in the same file
2. Place event handlers near the state classes they modify
3. For larger applications, create a dedicated `events` directory with files organized by feature

```python box
# Example organization in a larger application
# events/user_events.py
@rx.event
def update_user(state: UserState, name: str, age: int):
    state.name = name
    state.age = age

@rx.event
def delete_user(state: UserState):
    state.name = ""
    state.age = 0
```

### Combining with Other Event Features

Decentralized event handlers work seamlessly with other Reflex event features:

```python box
# Background event
@rx.event(background=True)
async def long_running_task(state: AppState):
    # Long-running task implementation
    pass

# Event chaining
@rx.event
def process_form(state: FormState, data: dict):
    # Process form data
    return validate_data  # Chain to another event
```


```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Setters

Every base var has a built-in event handler to set it's value for convenience, called `set_VARNAME`.

Say you wanted to change the value of the select component. You could write your own event handler to do this:

```python demo exec

options: list[str] = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]
class SetterState1(rx.State):
    selected: str = "1"

    @rx.event
    def change(self, value):
        self.selected = value


def code_setter():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.badge(SetterState1.selected, color_scheme="green"),
        rx.select(
            options,
            on_change= lambda value: SetterState1.change(value),
        )
    )

```

Or you could could use a built-in setter for conciseness.

```python demo exec

options: list[str] = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]
class SetterState2(rx.State):
    selected: str = "1"

    @rx.event
    def set_selected(self, selected: str):
        self.selected = selected

def code_setter_2():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.badge(SetterState2.selected, color_scheme="green"),
        rx.select(
            options,
            on_change= SetterState2.set_selected,
        )
    )
```

In this example, the setter for `selected` is `set_selected`. Both of these examples are equivalent.

Setters are a great way to make your code more concise. But if you want to do something more complicated, you can always write your own function in the state.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
from pcweb import constants, styles
```

# Background Tasks

A background task is a special type of `EventHandler` that may run
concurrently with other `EventHandler` functions. This enables long-running
tasks to execute without blocking UI interactivity.

A background task is defined by decorating an async `State` method with
`@rx.event(background=True)`.

```md alert warning
# `@rx.event(background=True)` used to be called `@rx.background`.
In Reflex version 0.6.5 and later, the `@rx.background` decorator has been renamed to `@rx.event(background=True)`.
```

Whenever a background task needs to interact with the state, **it must enter an
`async with self` context block** which refreshes the state and takes an
exclusive lock to prevent other tasks or event handlers from modifying it
concurrently. Because other `EventHandler` functions may modify state while the
task is running, **outside of the context block, Vars accessed by the background
task may be _stale_**. Attempting to modify the state from a background task
outside of the context block will raise an `ImmutableStateError` exception.

In the following example, the `my_task` event handler is decorated with
`@rx.event(background=True)` and increments the `counter` variable every half second, as
long as certain conditions are met. While it is running, the UI remains
interactive and continues to process events normally.

```md alert info
# Background events are similar to simple Task Queues like [Celery](https://www.fullstackpython.com/celery.html) allowing asynchronous events.
```

```python demo exec id=background_demo
import asyncio
import reflex as rx


class MyTaskState(rx.State):
    counter: int = 0
    max_counter: int = 10
    running: bool = False
    _n_tasks: int = 0

    @rx.event
    def set_max_counter(self, value: str):
        self.max_counter = int(value)

    @rx.event(background=True)
    async def my_task(self):
        async with self:
            # The latest state values are always available inside the context
            if self._n_tasks > 0:
                # only allow 1 concurrent task
                return

            # State mutation is only allowed inside context block
            self._n_tasks += 1

        while True:
            async with self:
                # Check for stopping conditions inside context
                if self.counter >= self.max_counter:
                    self.running = False
                if not self.running:
                    self._n_tasks -= 1
                    return

                self.counter += 1

            # Await long operations outside the context to avoid blocking UI
            await asyncio.sleep(0.5)

    @rx.event
    def toggle_running(self):
        self.running = not self.running
        if self.running:
            return MyTaskState.my_task

    @rx.event
    def clear_counter(self):
        self.counter = 0


def background_task_example():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.heading(MyTaskState.counter, " /"),
        rx.input(
            value=MyTaskState.max_counter,
            on_change=MyTaskState.set_max_counter,
            width="8em",
        ),
        rx.button(
            rx.cond(~MyTaskState.running, "Start", "Stop"),
            on_click=MyTaskState.toggle_running,
        ),
        rx.button(
            "Reset",
            on_click=MyTaskState.clear_counter,
        ),
    )
```

## Terminating Background Tasks on Page Close or Navigation

Sometimes, background tasks may continue running even after the user navigates away from the page or closes the browser tab. To handle such cases, you can check if the websocket associated with the state is disconnected and terminate the background task when necessary.

The solution involves checking if the client_token is still valid in the app.event_namespace.token_to_sid mapping. If the session is lost (e.g., the user navigates away or closes the page), the background task will stop.

```python
import asyncio
import reflex as rx

class State(rx.State):
    @rx.event(background=True)
    async def loop_function(self):
        while True:
            if self.router.session.client_token not in app.event_namespace.token_to_sid:
                print("WebSocket connection closed or user navigated away. Stopping background task.")
                break 
            
            print("Running background task...")
            await asyncio.sleep(2)  


@rx.page(on_load=State.loop_function)
def index():
    return rx.text("Hello, this page will manage background tasks and stop them when the page is closed or navigated away.")

```

## Task Lifecycle

When a background task is triggered, it starts immediately, saving a reference to
the task in `app.background_tasks`. When the task completes, it is removed from
the set.

Multiple instances of the same background task may run concurrently, and the
framework makes no attempt to avoid duplicate tasks from starting.

It is up to the developer to ensure that duplicate tasks are not created under
the circumstances that are undesirable. In the example above, the `_n_tasks`
backend var is used to control whether `my_task` will enter the increment loop,
or exit early.




## Background Task Limitations

Background tasks mostly work like normal `EventHandler` methods, with certain exceptions:

- Background tasks must be `async` functions.
- Background tasks cannot modify the state outside of an `async with self` context block.
- Background tasks may read the state outside of an `async with self` context block, but the value may be stale.
- Background tasks may not be directly called from other event handlers or background tasks. Instead use `yield` or `return` to trigger the background task.


```python exec
import reflex as rx

from pcweb.pages.docs.library import library
```

# Events Overview

Events are composed of two parts: Event Triggers and Event Handlers.

- **Events Handlers** are how the State of a Reflex application is updated. They are triggered by user interactions with the UI, such as clicking a button or hovering over an element. Events can also be triggered by the page loading or by other events.

- **Event triggers** are component props that create an event to be sent to an event handler.
Each component supports a set of events triggers. They are described in each [component's documentation]({library.path}) in the event trigger section.


## Example 
Lets take a look at an example below. Try mousing over the heading to change the word.

```python demo exec
class WordCycleState(rx.State):
    # The words to cycle through.
    text: list[str] = ["Welcome", "to", "Reflex", "!"]

    # The index of the current word.
    index: int = 0

    @rx.event
    def next_word(self):
        self.index = (self.index + 1) % len(self.text)

    @rx.var
    def get_text(self) -> str:
        return self.text[self.index]

def event_triggers_example():
    return rx.heading(
        WordCycleState.get_text,
        on_mouse_over=WordCycleState.next_word,
        color="green",
    )

```

In this example, the heading component has the **event trigger**, `on_mouse_over`.
Whenever the user hovers over the heading, the `next_word` **event handler** will be called to cycle the word. Once the handler returns, the UI will be updated to reflect the new state.

Adding the `@rx.event` decorator above the event handler is strongly recommended. This decorator enables proper static type checking, which ensures event handlers receive the correct number and types of arguments.

# What's in this section?

In the event section of the documentation, you will explore the different types of events supported by Reflex, along with the different ways to call them.


```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Page Load Events

You can also specify a function to run when the page loads. This can be useful for fetching data once vs on every render or state change.
In this example, we fetch data when the page loads:

```python
class State(rx.State):
    data: Dict[str, Any]

    @rx.event
    def get_data(self):
        # Fetch data
        self.data = fetch_data()

@rx.page(on_load=State.get_data)
def index():
    return rx.text('A Beautiful App')
```

Another example would be checking if the user is authenticated when the page loads. If the user is not authenticated, we redirect them to the login page. If they are authenticated, we don't do anything, letting them access the page. This `on_load` event would be placed on every page that requires authentication to access.

```python
class State(rx.State):
    authenticated: bool

    @rx.event
    def check_auth(self):
        # Check if user is authenticated
        self.authenticated = check_auth()
        if not self.authenticated:
            return rx.redirect('/login')

@rx.page(on_load=State.check_auth)
def index():
    return rx.text('A Beautiful App')
```
